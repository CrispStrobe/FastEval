            "question": "Suppose the angular separation of two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of your eyes. How will the stars appear to your eyes?\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The angular separation of two stars refers to the amount of time it takes for the two stars to subtend a certain angle in the sky. If the angular separation is smaller than the angular resolution of your eyes, then the two stars will appear to be very close together and may even look like a single point of light. This is because the human eye has a limited ability to distinguish between small angular differences. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.",

            "model_answer": "The inner planets are made of denser materials than the outer planets because of the following reasons:\n\n(A) In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster, centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula. This means that the lighter materials were pushed away from the center of the nebula and the denser materials remained closer to the center.\n\n(B) In the inner part of the nebula, only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures. Hydrogen compounds, although more abundant, were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions. This means that the denser materials, which are metals and rocks, were more likely to form in the inner part of the nebula and the lighter materials, which are hydrogen compounds, were more likely to form in the outer part.\n\n(C) Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula. This means that the denser materials, which are heavier, would naturally settle at the bottom of the nebula and the lighter materials, which are less dense, would float on top.\n\n(D) When the solar nebula formed a disk, materials naturally segregated into bands. In our particular solar system, the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part. This means that the denser materials, which are closer to the Sun, would be more likely to form the inner planets while the lighter materials, which are further away from the Sun, would be more likely to form the outer planets.\n\nTherefore, the inner planets are made of denser materials than the outer planets because of the combination of these factors.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Ptolemy had the planets orbiting Earth on 'circles upon circles' in his model of the universe because he believed that the Earth was at the center of the universe and all other celestial bodies, including the planets, revolved around it. This belief was based on the geocentric model of the universe, which was widely accepted at the time.\n\nThe geocentric model was developed by Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BCE, but it was Ptolemy who refined and popularized it. Ptolemy's model was based on the idea that the Earth was at the center of a sphere, and all other celestial bodies, including the planets, were located on circles that revolved around the Earth.\n\nPtolemy's model was able to account for the fact that planets sometimes appeared to move westward rather than eastward relative to the stars in our sky. This was because the Earth was rotating on its own axis while the planets were orbiting around it. As a result, the apparent position of the planets in the sky changed over time, and they sometimes appeared to move westward.\n\nPtolemy's model was also able to explain why more distant planets take longer to make a circuit through the constellations of the zodiac. This was because the planets were located on circles that were further away from the Earth, and it took longer for them to complete their orbits.\n\nHowever, Ptolemy's model was not able to properly account for the varying distances of the planets from Earth. This was because he believed that the Earth was at the center of the universe, and all other celestial bodies, including the planets, were located on circles that revolved around the Earth. As a result, he was unable to accurately calculate the distances between the Earth and the planets.\n\nIn conclusion, Ptolemy had the planets orbiting Earth on 'circles upon circles' in his model of the universe because he believed that the Earth was at the center of the universe and all other celestial bodies, including the planets, revolved around it. This belief was based on the geocentric model of the universe, which was widely accepted at the time.",

            "model_answer": "The visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum is between wavelengths of approximately 380 to 740 nanometers (nm). This range is commonly referred to as the \"visible light\" spectrum.\n\nTo understand why this is the case, we need to know that the electromagnetic spectrum is divided into different regions based on the wavelength of the light. The visible light spectrum is one of these regions, and it includes the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n\nThe wavelengths of these colors are as follows:\n\n* Red: 620-740 nm\n* Orange: 590-620 nm\n* Yellow: 570-590 nm\n* Green: 510-570 nm\n* Blue: 450-490 nm\n* Indigo: 400-450 nm\n* Violet: 380-400 nm\n\nAs we can see, the visible light spectrum includes the wavelengths of all of these colors, which is why it is commonly referred to as the \"visible light\" spectrum.
