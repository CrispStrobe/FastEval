The potential energy of the mass is given by:\n\nPotential Energy = mgh\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the object above its reference point.\n\nIn this case, the mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position, so h = 0.030 m. The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nPotential Energy = (0.30 kg)(9.8 m/s^2)(0.030 m) = 0.27 J\n\n2. The kinetic energy of the mass is given by:\n\nKinetic Energy = 0.5 \\* m \\* v^2\n\nwhere v is the speed of the object. In this case, the speed of the mass is 0.040 m/s.

Then, the angle of reflection on the water is \u03b83, and the angle of reflection on the oil is \u03b84.\n\nUsing Snell's Law, we can write:\n\nn1 sin(\u03b81) = n2 sin(\u03b82)\nn2 sin(\u03b82) = n1 sin(\u03b83)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction of the two media.\n\nWe know that n1 = 1.33 (water) and n2 = 1.5 (oil). We also know that \u03b81 = 90\u00b0 (since white light is incident perpendicular to the surface of the water).\n\nUsing these values, we can solve for \u03b82 and \u03b83:\n\nsin(\u03b82) = n1 sin(\u03b81) / n2\nsin(\u03b82) = 1.33 / 1.5\nsin(\u03b82) = 0.9\n\u03b82 = arcsin(0.9)\n\u03b82 = 73.1\u00b0\n\nsin(\u03b83) = n2 sin(\u03b82) / n1\nsin(\u03b83) = 1.5 sin(73.1\u00b0) / 1.33\nsin(\u03b83) = 0.9\n\u03b83 = arcsin(0.9)\n\u03b83 = 73.1\u00b0\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the most strongly reflected wavelength is the one with the smallest angle of incidence on the oil. Since \u03b82 is smaller than \u03b83, the most strongly reflected wavelength is the one with the smallest angle of incidence on the oil, which is \u03b82.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is (B) 550 nm.",
