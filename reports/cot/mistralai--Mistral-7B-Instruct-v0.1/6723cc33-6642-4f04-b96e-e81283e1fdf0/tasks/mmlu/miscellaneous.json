            "model_answer": "To estimate the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year, we can consider the following steps:\n\n1. According to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), in 2019, there were approximately 1.3 billion movie theater admissions in the United States.\n2. However, not all movies are shown in theaters. Many are released directly on streaming platforms or DVD/Blu-ray.\n3. It's difficult to precisely estimate the percentage of movies that are not shown in theaters, but it's likely that a significant portion of them are not.\n4. Given this, let's assume that only 10% of movies are not shown in theaters. This means that 90% of movies are shown in theaters.\n5. If we multiply the total number of movie theater admissions (1.3 billion) by the percentage of movies shown in theaters (90%), we get an estimate of the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year:\n\n(1.3 billion) x (0.9) = 1.17 billion\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 200,000,000.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to know the amount of ice used by Americans per year and the amount of energy required to melt that ice. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to estimate the amount of ice used by Americans per year. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the average American uses about 80 pounds of ice per year. However, this is just an estimate and the actual amount could be higher or lower.\n2. Next, we need to know the amount of energy required to melt one pound of ice. The specific heat of ice is about 2.11 J/g, which means that to melt one pound of ice (which is equal to 0.4536 kilograms), we need 0.4536 kg \\* 2.11 J/g = 0.984 J of energy.\n3. Now, we can calculate the total amount of energy required to melt all the ice used by Americans per year. If we assume that all the ice used by Americans per year is melted, then we need 80 pounds/year \\* 0.984 J/pound = 78.72 J/year.\n4. However, the question asks for the amount of energy wasted by throwing out unused ice in drinks. Since we don't know the percentage of ice that is thrown out, we can only estimate the maximum amount of energy that could be wasted. If we assume that 100% of the ice in drinks is thrown out, then the amount of energy wasted would be 78.72 J/year \\* 100% = 78.72 J/year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 6*10^11 J.",
