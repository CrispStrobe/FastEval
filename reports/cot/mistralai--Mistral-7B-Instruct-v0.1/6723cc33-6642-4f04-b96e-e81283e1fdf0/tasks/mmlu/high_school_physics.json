At the highest point, the ball's speed is zero, but it is not zero because it is at the highest point. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nII. The ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point.\nThis statement is true. At the highest point, the ball's acceleration is zero because it is not moving. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\nThis statement is true. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point because it is moving against the force of gravity, while it falls back down more quickly because it is moving with the force of gravity.

The total mass of the two carts is m + 4m = 5m.\n\nNext, let's consider the conservation of energy. Since the collision is elastic, the total kinetic energy of the two carts before the collision is equal to the total kinetic energy after the collision.\n\nLet's denote the kinetic energy of the small cart before the collision as K1 and the kinetic energy of the large cart before the collision as K2. Then, the kinetic energy of the small cart after the collision is 0.5K2, since the large cart loses half its kinetic energy to the small cart.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the large cart after the collision is K2 - 0.5K2 = 0.5K2.\n\nSince the total mass of the two carts is 5m, we can write the equation:\n\nK1 + K2 = 0.5K2 + 0.5K2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nK1 = 0.5K2\n\nNow, let's use the conservation of momentum. The total momentum of the two carts before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.\n\nLet's denote the momentum of the small cart before the collision as p1 and the momentum of the large cart before the collision as p2. Then, the momentum of the small cart after the collision is -p2, since the large cart loses momentum to the small cart.\n\nThe momentum of the large cart after the collision is p2 - p2 = 0, since its momentum is conserved.\n\nSince the total mass of the two carts is 5m, we can write the equation:\n\np1 + p2 = -p2 + 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\np1 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the conservation of energy and momentum to find the velocities of the two carts after the collision.\n\nFrom the conservation of energy, we know that:\n\n0.5K2 = 0.5(mv^2)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nv = sqrt(K2/m)\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, we know that:\n\n-p2 = mv\n\nSubstituting the value of p2 from the conservation of energy, we get:\n\n-0.5K2 = mv\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nv = -sqrt(K2/m)\n\nSince the large cart loses half its kinetic energy to the small cart, we know that:\n\nK2 = 0.5K1\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation for v, we get:\n\nv = -sqrt(0.5K1/m)\n\nNow, we can use the conservation of energy to find the velocity of the small cart after the collision:\n\n0.5K2 = 0.5(mv^2)\n\n0.5(0.5K1) = 0.5(mv^2)\n\nK1 = mv^2\n\nSubstituting the value of v from the equation for v, we get:\n\nK1 = m(-sqrt(0.5K1/m))^2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nK1 = 0.5K1\n\nDividing both sides by 0.5, we get:\n\nK1 = K2\n\nNow, we can use the equation for v to find the velocity of the small cart after the collision:\n\nv = -sqrt(K2/m)\n\nSubstituting the value of K2 from the equation for K1, we get:\n\nv = -sqrt(0.5K1/m)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n(A) 1.41v",

Buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the displaced water, which is equal to the weight of the object.\n\nLet's assume that the object is completely submerged in the water. In this case, the buoyancy force would be equal to the weight of the object, which is 6 N.\n\nHowever, we know that the object is floating, which means that the buoyancy force is greater than the weight of the object. Therefore, the object must be partially submerged in the water, and the buoyancy force must be equal to the weight of the displaced water plus the weight of the object.\n\nLet's denote the volume of the displaced water as Vd. The weight of the displaced water is equal to the weight of the object, which is 6 N. Therefore, the buoyancy force is equal to:\n\nFb = Fd + 6 N\n\nwhere Fd is the buoyancy force due to the displaced water.\n\nSince the object is partially submerged in the water, the volume of the displaced water is equal to the volume of the object minus the volume of the object that is above the surface of the water. Therefore, we can write:\n\nVd = Vobj - Vobj_above_surface\n\nwhere Vobj is the total volume of the object and Vobj_above_surface is the volume of the object that is above the surface of the water.\n\nSubstituting this expression for Vd into the equation for the buoyancy force, we get:\n\nFb = Fd + 6 N\nFd = Vobj_above_surface \u00d7 \u03c1gVobj_above_surface\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the density of water and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nWe can simplify this expression by dividing both sides by Vobj_above_surface:\n\nFd/Vobj_above_surface = \u03c1g\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for Fd into the equation for the buoyancy force:\n\nFb = (Vobj_above_surface \u00d7 \u03c1g) + 6 N\n\nWe can simplify this expression by dividing both sides by \u03c1g:\n\nFb/\u03c1g = Vobj_above_surface + 6/\u03c1\n\nWe can now solve for Vobj_above_surface by subtracting 6/\u03c1 from both sides:\n\nVobj_above_surface = Fb/\u03c1g - 6/\u03c1\n\nSubstituting this expression for Vobj_above_surface into the equation for the volume of the object, we get:\n\nVobj = Vobj_above_surface + Vobj_below_surface\n\nWe can solve for Vobj_below_surface by subtracting Vobj_above_surface from both sides:\n\nVobj_below_surface = Vobj - Vobj_above_surface\n\nSubstituting this expression for Vobj_below_surface into the equation for the volume of the object, we get:\n\nVobj = Vobj_above_surface + (Vobj - Vobj_above_surface)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nVobj = 2Vobj_above_surface\n\nSubstituting this expression for Vobj into the equation for the buoyancy force, we get:\n\nFb = (2Vobj_above_surface \u00d7 \u03c1g) + 6 N\n\nWe can simplify this expression by dividing both sides by \u03c1g:\n\nFb/\u03c1g = 2Vobj_above_surface + 6/\u03c1\n\nWe can now solve for Vobj_above_surface by subtracting 6/\u03c1 from both sides:\n\nVobj_above_surface = Fb/\u03c1g - 6/\u03c1\n\nSubstituting this expression for Vobj_above_surface into the equation for the percentage of the object's volume above the surface of the water, we get:\n\nPercentage = (Vobj_above_surface / Vobj) \u00d7 100%\n\nSubstituting the expression for Vobj_above_surface that we derived earlier, we get:\n\nPercentage = ((Fb/\u03c1g - 6/\u03c1) / (2Vobj_above_surface)) \u00d7 100%\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nPercentage = (Fb/\u03c1g - 6/\u03c1) \u00d7 50%\n\nSubstituting the values for Fb, \u03c1, and g that we used earlier, we get:\n\nPercentage = (6 N / (9.81 m/s^2 \u00d7 1000 kg/m^3)) \u00d7 50%\n\nPercentage = 11.96%\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 12%.",
