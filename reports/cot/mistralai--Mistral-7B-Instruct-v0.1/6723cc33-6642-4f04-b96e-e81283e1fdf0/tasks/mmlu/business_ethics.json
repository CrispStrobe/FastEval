            "model_answer": "The enlightened self-interest model of CSR is (C) That it is in an organization's own best interest to act in an ethical way.\n\nThis model suggests that an organization's success is not only determined by its financial performance but also by its ethical behavior. By acting in an ethical way, an organization can build trust with its stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors. This trust can lead to long-term success and profitability.\n\nIn contrast, the other options suggest that an organization's success is determined solely by its financial performance or by considering the interests of shareholders or following the law. These models may not take into account the long-term consequences of unethical behavior and may not build trust with stakeholders.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Predatory pricing refers to a business strategy where a company lowers its prices to drive its competitors out of business. This can be done by offering lower prices than the competition, or by offering a lower price for a product or service that is of equal or higher quality.\n\nTo determine whether a company is engaging in predatory pricing, it is important to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Market power: The company must have a significant amount of market power, which means it has the ability to influence the prices and terms of trade in the market.\n2. Price difference: The company must be offering prices that are significantly lower than those of its competitors.\n3. Intention: The company must have the intention of driving its competitors out of business through its pricing strategy.\n\nBased on these factors, we can eliminate options (C) and (D) as they do not meet the requirement of having a significant amount of market power.\n\nOption (A) is also incorrect as it does not specify the price difference between the company and its competitors.\n\nOption (B) is the correct answer as it specifies the price difference between the company and its competitors, which is a key factor in determining whether predatory pricing is occurring.",

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a piece of legislation that was enacted in the United States to address corporate fraud and improve financial reporting. On the other hand, the Unethical Corporate Practices Act is not a real piece of legislation, but rather a hypothetical one that could be used to drive ethical business practices.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Legislation, Sarbanes-Oxley Act.",
