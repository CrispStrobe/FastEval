This means that there is no room for judges to exercise discretion or to consider multiple factors when making a decision.\n\nThe proposition that is most inconsistent with this claim is (C) Judges exercise strong discretion. This proposition suggests that judges have the power to make decisions based on their own personal beliefs and values, rather than following a strict set of rules or principles. This is in direct conflict with Dworkin's claim that there is only one right answer to every legal question.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

            "model_answer": "Robert Nozick's proposed formula for determining the appropriate punishment is r x H. Let's break down the formula step-by-step:\n\n1. \"r\" represents the risk of reoffending. This refers to the likelihood that the offender will commit another crime if they are released from prison.\n2. \"H\" represents the harm caused by the crime. This refers to the degree of harm that the offender has caused to the victim or the community.\n3. To determine the appropriate punishment, we need to multiply the risk of reoffending by the harm caused by the crime. This gives us a measure of the total harm that the offender has caused and the likelihood that they will cause harm again if released from prison.\n4. Therefore, the appropriate punishment would be a combination of the risk of reoffending and the harm caused by the crime.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Effectiveness of rehabilitation of multiplied by hazard to the community.",

It emphasizes the importance of legal rules and their enforcement, and rejects the idea that the law should reflect moral or ethical principles.\n\nOption (A) is inaccurate because it suggests that legal positivism regards morals and law as inseparable. However, legal positivism explicitly rejects this idea and holds that morality has no place in the law.\n\nOption (B) is inaccurate because it suggests that legal positivism perceives law as commands. However, legal positivism views law as a set of rules that are enforced by the state, but it does not regard these rules as commands in the traditional sense.\n\nOption (C) is accurate because it describes one of the key features of legal positivism, which is that a legal order is seen as a closed logical system.\n\nOption (D) is inaccurate because it suggests that legal positivism holds that there is no necessary connection between morality and law.

This correlativity is necessary for the will theory to function properly.\n\nIf we were to remove this correlativity, it would be difficult to formulate the interest theory. The interest theory maintains that individuals have certain interests that should be protected by society. However, without the correlativity of rights and duties, it would be unclear how these interests should be protected or who should be responsible for protecting them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Regarding X's interest as directly related to Y's duty.
