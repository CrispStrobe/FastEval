However, if the main character made a mistake and did not intend to mislead the customer, it may be considered less wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I handed my brother the toilet brush so he could clean his teeth.\n\n* The main character is a parent who is helping their child with their oral hygiene routine.\n* The main character hands their child a toilet brush instead of a toothbrush, which is the appropriate tool for cleaning teeth.\n* It is not clear whether the main character intentionally gave their child the wrong tool or made a mistake.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it is generally considered wrong to intentionally give someone the wrong tool or information, especially when it comes to something as important as their health or well-being.
