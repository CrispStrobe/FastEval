            "model_answer": "To determine which of Swift's segments are required to be separately disclosed in its December 31 year 2 financial statements, we need to follow the rules for segment reporting.\n\nSegment reporting requires a company to report financial information for each operating segment that meets certain criteria. An operating segment is a group of activities that are similar in nature and are engaged in by the company to provide goods or services to external customers.\n\nTo be separately disclosed, a segment must meet the following criteria:\n\n1. The segment must be identifiable. This means that it must be distinct from other segments and must be capable of being separately identified in the company's financial statements.\n2. The segment must be material. This means that it must have a significant impact on the company's financial performance.\n3. The segment must be managed separately. This means that the segment must be managed as a separate unit within the company, with its own budget, resources, and decision-making processes.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can determine which segments meet these criteria:\n\nSegment A has reported revenue of $42, which is less than 5% of the total reported revenue. Therefore, it is not material and does not need to be separately disclosed.\n\nSegment B has reported revenue of $121, which is more than 5% of the total reported revenue. Therefore, it is material and needs to be separately disclosed.\n\nSegment C has reported revenue of $14, which is less than 5% of the total reported revenue. Therefore, it is not material and does not need to be separately disclosed.\n\nSegment B and C together have reported revenue of $135, which is more than 5% of the total reported revenue. Therefore, both segments are material and need to be separately disclosed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) B and C only.",

The question is asking about the elements of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice.\n\nStep 2: Review the options given in the question. The options are (A) Acceptance of a client relationship, (B) Professional skepticism of management, (C) Computer information processing, and (D) Efficiency of organizational structures.\n\nStep 3: Identify the relevant quality control policies and procedures for an auditing practice. Quality control policies and procedures for an auditing practice typically include procedures for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial statements, procedures for identifying and addressing audit risks, procedures for maintaining independence and objectivity, and procedures for communicating with clients and management.\n\nStep 4: Determine which of the options are relevant to quality control policies and procedures for an auditing practice. The options (A) Acceptance of a client relationship, (D) Efficiency of organizational structures are not directly related to quality control policies and procedures for an auditing practice.\n\nStep 5: Eliminate the options that are not relevant.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To calculate Palmyra's comprehensive income, we need to follow the order of operations and consider all the given components.\n\n1. First, we need to adjust for the change in accounting principle. Since the net cumulative effect is positive, it means that the change in principle has resulted in an increase in net income. Therefore, we add the net cumulative effect to the net income.\n2. Next, we need to account for the unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities. This loss is not yet realized, so it does not affect the current period's comprehensive income.\n3. Then, we need to consider the foreign currency translation adjustment. This adjustment is added to the net income to reflect the difference in accounting standards between the home country and the foreign country where the business operates.\n4. Finally, we need to account for the increase in common stock. This increase is not related to the company's operations and does not affect the net income.\n\nConsidering all these components, we can calculate Palmyra's comprehensive income as follows:\n\nComprehensive income = Net income + Net cumulative effect + Foreign currency translation adjustment + Increase in common stock\n\nComprehensive income = $11,000 + $1,000 + $2,000 + $6,000\n\nComprehensive income = $18,000\n\nTherefore, Palmyra's comprehensive income is (D) $17,000.",

Cumulative preferred stock is a type of preferred stock that allows the holder to accumulate unpaid dividends over time.\n2. Public corporations are government-owned entities that operate as businesses and generate revenue.\n3. When a public corporation issues cumulative preferred stock, it is typically done to raise capital for the corporation.\n4. In exchange for the investment, the holder of the cumulative preferred stock is entitled to a fixed dividend rate and the right to convert the preferred stock into common stock at a later date.\n5. However, the most important right that a holder of cumulative preferred stock is entitled to is the right to receive guaranteed dividends.\n6. This means that the holder of the cumulative preferred stock is entitled to receive a dividend payment for each year that the dividend is not paid, up to a certain limit.\n7. This guarantee provides a level of stability and predictability for the holder of the cumulative preferred stock, making it an attractive investment option for those seeking a steady income stream.\n8.
