            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "A complete bilateral cleft palate is due to failure of fusion of the palatine processes. The palatine processes are the bony structures that fuse together to form the roof of the mouth, or the palate. Failure of fusion of these processes results in a cleft palate, which is a congenital defect that affects the development of the face and mouth. The other options do not accurately describe the cause of a complete bilateral cleft palate. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",

These muscles work together to expand the rib cage and increase the volume of the thoracic cavity, which allows for the intake of air. The diaphragm is also active during inspiration, but it is not the primary muscle group. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) External and internal intercostal muscles.",

When we bend our forearm, we are moving it towards our body. This movement is not an abduction, as the arm is not moving away from the body. It is not an eversion or pronation, as these involve turning the palm of the hand. Therefore, the correct term to describe this motion is flexion.",

The jejunum is the middle part of the small intestine and is where most of the nutrients are absorbed.

In a healthy mouth, the mucosa and gingiva are in close contact and blend seamlessly into each other.\n\nThe color of the mucosa in a healthy mouth is typically light pink, which is due to the presence of capillaries and small blood vessels just beneath the surface of the mucosa. The color of the gingiva is typically a darker shade of pink or red, depending on the individual's genetics and overall health.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) light pink in color on both sides of the mucogingival junction.",
