            "model_answer": "The author who emphasized strategy as achieving competitive advantage for an organization is Michael Porter. He wrote a book called \"Competitive Strategy\" in 1980, which is considered a seminal work in the field of strategy. In this book, Porter introduced the concept of the Five Forces, which are used to analyze the competitive landscape of an industry and develop strategies to gain a competitive advantage. Porter's work has had a significant impact on the field of strategy and is still widely used today. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Steyn (2003) as he is not the author who emphasized strategy as achieving competitive advantage for an organization.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which form of communication is most effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Reach: Which form of communication has the potential to reach the largest number of people?\n2. Persuasiveness: Which form of communication is most likely to persuade people to change their predispositions?\n3. Interactivity: Which form of communication allows for two-way communication and feedback?\n\nBased on these factors, we can eliminate options (D) Public and (C) Group, as they do not have the potential to reach a large number of people and do not allow for two-way communication.\n\nOption (A) Interpersonal communication is the most effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue. This is because interpersonal communication allows for direct and personal interaction between individuals, which can be more persuasive than mass media. Additionally, interpersonal communication allows for two-way feedback and the ability to tailor messages to specific individuals, making it more effective in changing predispositions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Interpersonal.",

            "model_answer": "Esman (1972) identifies four types of publics that can help an organization exist: enabling, functional, normative, and diffused.\n\n1. Enabling publics: These are the publics that provide the resources and support necessary for an organization to exist. They include customers, suppliers, and investors who provide financial resources, as well as employees who provide labor and expertise.\n2. Functional publics: These are the publics that provide the organization with information and feedback that are necessary for it to function effectively. They include employees, customers, and suppliers who provide feedback on the organization's products and services, as well as government agencies that provide regulatory information.\n3. Normative publics: These are the publics that provide the organization with moral and ethical guidance. They include religious and ethical organizations, as well as the general public who hold the organization accountable for its actions.\n4. Diffused publics: These are the publics that are not directly affected by the organization's activities but have an interest in its behavior. They include the general public who may be concerned about the organization's impact on society, as well as other organizations that may be affected by the organization's actions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is (A) Enabling.",

In 2010, the Italian fashion house Karl Lagerfeld accused the French fashion house Chanel of stealing one of his designs.\n2. Lagerfeld claimed that Chanel had used his design without permission and had passed it off as their own.\n3. Chanel denied the accusations and filed a lawsuit against Lagerfeld for defamation.\n4. The case was settled out of court in 2014, with Chanel agreeing to pay a large sum of money to Lagerfeld.\n5. The settlement was seen as an acknowledgement by Chanel of the validity of Lagerfeld's claims and an apology for any damage to its reputation.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Chanel.",

Early theories suggested that audiences were passive recipients of media messages and thus vulnerable to manipulation. However, current thinking suggests that audiences are not as passive as they were once thought to be.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because it does not relate to the topic of mass communication and its effects on audiences. Option (D) is also incorrect because it focuses on the technology used for mass communication rather than the effects of the messages themselves.\n\nOption (C) is partially correct because it acknowledges that not all audiences are uniformly affected by mass communication messages. However, it does not go far enough to suggest that audiences are actively engaging with the media.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Audiences are more active and less vulnerable than ever before.",
