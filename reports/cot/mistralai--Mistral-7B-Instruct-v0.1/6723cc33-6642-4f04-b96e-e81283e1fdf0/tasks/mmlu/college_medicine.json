            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The body compensates for increased environmental temperature by:\n\n1. Increasing respiration rate: When the body is exposed to high temperatures, it increases its respiration rate to cool down. This is because heat is released when the body exhales.\n2. Increasing heart rate: The body also increases its heart rate to pump more blood to the skin and sweat glands, which helps to cool down the body.\n3. Decreasing salt retention: The body decreases its salt retention when it is exposed to high temperatures. This is because salt can cause the body to lose water, which can lead to dehydration and overheating.\n4. Increasing water lost through skin: The body increases its water loss through the skin when it is exposed to high temperatures. This is because sweating is the body's primary mechanism for cooling down.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) increasing water lost through skin",

            "model_answer": "The main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is:\n\n(D) uptake and oxidation by other tissues.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Lactate is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism in muscles.\n2. When lactate levels become too high, they can cause muscle fatigue and cramps.\n3. To remove lactate from the bloodstream, it needs to be converted into a more soluble compound or excreted via the kidneys.\n4. However, the liver is the primary organ responsible for converting lactate into urea, which is then excreted via the kidneys.\n5. This process is known as the Cori cycle, which involves the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, then to acetyl-CoA, and finally to urea.\n6. While the liver does play a role in converting lactate to urea, it is not the only organ that can do so. Other tissues, such as the kidneys and intestines, can also convert lactate to urea.\n7. Therefore, the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is uptake and oxidation by other tissues, including the liver, kidneys, and intestines.",

            "model_answer": "When the rate of glycolysis is high, the production of ATP and NADH can cause a decrease in pH within the cell. This can be harmful to many cellular processes, including protein function and enzyme activity. To limit these pH changes, cells can use intracellular buffers.\n\nIntracellular buffers are molecules that can absorb or release protons (H+) in response to changes in pH. This helps to maintain a stable pH within the cell. There are several types of intracellular buffers, including bicarbonate (HCO3-) and phosphate (HPO4-).\n\nOne example of an intracellular buffer that can act to limit pH changes during high rates of glycolysis is carnosine (Carnosine). Carnosine is a diacidic molecule that can absorb protons in acidic conditions and release them in basic conditions. This helps to maintain a stable pH within the cell.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Carnosine.",

Blood lactate concentration is a measure of the amount of lactic acid in the blood.\n2. During high-intensity exercise, such as in soccer, the body produces lactic acid to generate energy.\n3. As the game progresses, the players become more fatigued and their ability to produce energy decreases.\n4. This leads to an increase in blood lactate concentration as the body struggles to maintain its energy levels.\n5. Therefore, the blood lactate concentration typically increases throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued.\n\nAnswer: D",

The breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine releases energy that can sustain maximal exertion exercise for a certain period of time.\n\nThe duration of time that ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise depends on several factors, including the intensity and duration of the exercise, the individual's fitness level, and the availability of other energy sources in the body.\n\nBased on these factors, it is reasonable to assume that ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise for a duration of 30-40 seconds. This is supported by research, which has shown that the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can provide energy for muscle contractions for up to 30 seconds during maximal exertion exercise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 30-40 seconds.",
