            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Philippa Foot explains the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction by appealing to (C) both A and B.\n\nThe killing/letting die distinction refers to the moral difference between actively killing someone and passively allowing them to die. Foot argues that this distinction is morally relevant because it involves two different types of rights: rights of noninterference and rights to goods and services.\n\nRights of noninterference refer to the right to be left alone and not have one's life interfered with by others. In the case of actively killing someone, this right is violated because the person's life is being intentionally ended. On the other hand, in the case of passively allowing someone to die, this right is not violated because the person's life is not being intentionally ended.\n\nRights to goods and services refer to the right to receive certain benefits or services from others. In the case of actively killing someone, this right is violated because the person is being denied the benefit of life. On the other hand, in the case of passively allowing someone to die, this right is not violated because the person is not being denied the benefit of life.\n\nTherefore, Foot argues that the killing/letting die distinction is morally relevant because it involves two different types of rights that are being violated in each case.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sandel's case against moral engineering can best be considered a virtue ethics approach.\n\nVirtue ethics is an ethical theory that emphasizes the development of moral character and virtues. It holds that moral actions are determined by the character of the person performing them, rather than by a set of rules or consequences. In this context, Sandel's case against moral engineering can be seen as an argument for the importance of cultivating virtues such as humility, compassion, and respect for diversity in decision-making processes.\n\nSandel argues that moral engineering, or the attempt to impose a particular moral vision on society through government policies and interventions, can be harmful because it undermines the development of moral character and virtues. He suggests that moral engineering can lead to a culture of conformity and intolerance, where individuals are forced to conform to a narrow set of moral values and are not encouraged to develop their own moral character.\n\nInstead, Sandel advocates for a more pluralistic and tolerant approach to moral decision-making, one that recognizes the diversity of moral values and perspectives in society. He suggests that this approach can foster the development of virtues such as empathy, respect, and open-mindedness, which are essential for building a just and compassionate society.\n\nTherefore, Sandel's case against moral engineering can best be considered a virtue ethics approach.",

This means that Marquis believes that abortion is wrong unless there are strong reasons to override this presumption.

However, Marquis also acknowledges that there may be situations where the fetus's rights are outweighed by the mother's interests, such as in cases of rape or incest.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what Carens means by \"liberal egalitarians.\" Liberal egalitarians are people who believe in both liberalism and egalitarianism. Liberalism is the belief in individual rights and freedoms, while egalitarianism is the belief in equal treatment for all people.\n\nNow, let's look at each of the options and see if they are concerns for all liberal egalitarians:\n\n(A) the ability of people to pursue their own projects: This is a concern for liberal egalitarians because they believe in individual rights and freedoms. However, it is not a concern for all liberal egalitarians because they also believe in equal treatment for all people. If people are given the ability to pursue their own projects, it may lead to inequalities in outcomes, which goes against the egalitarian aspect of liberal egalitarianism.\n\n(B) equal opportunity: This is a concern for all liberal egalitarians because they believe in equal treatment for all people. Everyone should have an equal chance to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\n(C) freedom of speech: This is a concern for liberal egalitarians because they believe in individual rights and freedoms. However, it is not a concern for all liberal egalitarians because they also believe in equal treatment for all people. If people are given the freedom to speak their minds, it may lead to inequalities in outcomes, which goes against the egalitarian aspect of liberal egalitarianism.\n\n(D) keeping actual inequalities as small as possible: This is a concern for all liberal egalitarians because they believe in equal treatment for all people. They want to minimize inequalities in outcomes and ensure that everyone has an equal chance to succeed.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that (A) and (C) are not concerns for all liberal egalitarians because they may lead to inequalities in outcomes, which goes against the egalitarian aspect of liberal egalitarianism. Therefore, the answer is (A) and (C).",
