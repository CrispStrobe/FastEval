            "model_answer": "Individuals do not enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organizations.\n\nIndividuals do not have the same rights and obligations as States and international organizations under international law. States and international organizations are considered legal entities with their own legal personalities, which means they can enter into agreements, sue and be sued, and hold property in their own names. Individuals, on the other hand, are not considered legal entities with their own legal personalities, and their rights and obligations under international law are generally derived from their national laws.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Individuals do not enjoy any international legal personality.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The 'living instrument principle' used by the European Court of Human Rights means that the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights must evolve to reflect changes in society and technology. This principle allows the court to take into account new developments and changes in the world when interpreting the convention.\n\nIn order to determine which of the cases best illustrates this principle, we need to consider how each case involved the interpretation of the convention in light of changes in society and technology.\n\nIn Golder v UK (1978), the court held that the right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the convention included the right to an impartial jury. This decision was based on the fact that juries were seen as an important part of the British legal system and that their impartiality was essential to the fairness of the trial.\n\nIn A v UK (2009), the court held that the right to privacy under Article 8 of the convention included the right to privacy in one's home. This decision was based on the fact that advances in technology, such as the use of CCTV cameras, had made it easier for the government to monitor individuals in their homes.\n\nIn Goodwin v UK (2002), the court held that the right to life under Article 2 of the convention included the right to die with dignity. This decision was based on the fact that advances in medical technology had made it possible for individuals to live longer and more comfortable lives, and that the right to die with dignity was an important part of this.\n\nIn Osman v UK (1998), the court held that the right to life under Article 2 of the convention included the right to be free from arbitrary deprivation of life. This decision was based on the fact that advances in technology had made it possible for the government to carry out targeted assassinations, and that the right to life was an important part of preventing such actions.\n\nBased on these considerations, it can be argued that A v UK (2009) best illustrates the 'living instrument principle' used by the European Court of Human Rights. This case involved the interpretation of the right to privacy in light of advances in technology, which is a clear example of how the court must evolve its interpretation of the convention to reflect changes in society and technology.",

            "question": "What does the doctrine of incorporation suggest in respect of treaties?\n\n(A) The doctrine of incorporation requires that all treaties undergo legislative transformation before they become domestic law\n(B) The doctrine of incorporation does not require any further action at the domestic level\n(C) The doctrine of incorporation treats treaties as inferior to domestic law\n(D) The doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law. This means that once a treaty is ratified, it becomes part of the domestic legal system and can be enforced in domestic courts. The doctrine of incorporation is based on the idea that the domestic legal system has a duty to respect and give effect to international law, and that this duty extends to treaties. Therefore, the doctrine of incorporation requires that domestic courts interpret and apply treaties in accordance with their terms, even if they conflict with domestic law. This means that domestic courts must take into account the provisions of the treaty when interpreting and applying domestic law.",

In addition to the criteria mentioned in the question, the Commission imposed the following criteria:\n\n(A) The Commission required a commitment to submit disputes to the ICJ: The Commission recommended that the new states should commit to resolving their disputes through the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. This was seen as a way to ensure that disputes were resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law.\n\n(B) The Commission required a change in boundaries: The Commission recommended that the new states should have clearly defined and internationally recognized borders. This was seen as a way to prevent further conflicts and instability in the region.\n\n(C) The Commission required a commitment to human rights and democracy: The Commission recommended that the new states should commit to upholding human rights and democratic principles. This was seen as a way to ensure that the new states were stable and peaceful, and that their citizens had the right to participate in the political process.\n\n(D) The Commission required an exchange of ethnic populations: The Commission did not recommend an exchange of ethnic populations as a criterion for recognition. This was seen as a way to prevent further displacement and conflict in the region.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (C) The Commission required a commitment to human rights and democracy.",

This new dimension added an additional layer of scrutiny to the incorporation of UNSC resolutions, ensuring that they are consistent with the fundamental principles of justice and human rights.",
