            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to find out what percentage of Americans live in urban areas. According to the United States Census Bureau, an urban area is defined as a densely populated area with a high population density and a large number of housing units.\n\nTo determine the percentage of Americans living in urban areas, we can look at the data from the 2017 American Community Survey. The survey estimates that there were 229 million people living in urban areas in the United States in 2017.\n\nTo find the percentage of Americans living in urban areas, we can divide the number of people living in urban areas by the total population of the United States and then multiply by 100.\n\nThe total population of the United States in 2017 was approximately 328 million people. So, the percentage of Americans living in urban areas can be calculated as follows:\n\nPercentage of Americans living in urban areas = (Number of people living in urban areas / Total population) x 100\n\nPercentage of Americans living in urban areas = (229 million / 328 million) x 100\n\nPercentage of Americans living in urban areas = 0.6828 x 100\n\nPercentage of Americans living in urban areas = 68.28%\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 62%.",

However, this number includes children under the age of 15, and we are only interested in children between the ages of 5-14.\n\nAssuming that all child laborers between the ages of 5-14 are included in the ILO's estimate, we can use the following calculation:\n\nNumber of children between the ages of 5-14 = Total child laborers between the ages of 5-14 / Total child laborers\n\nNumber of children between the ages of 5-14 = 170 million / 170 million = 1\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 5 million.",

According to the UN, India's urban population in 2018 was about 41.8% of the total population. \n\nStep 2: However, we need to find the percentage of Indians living in urban areas as of 2017. Since the data for 2017 is not readily available, we can estimate it based on the trend in urbanization over the years. \n\nStep 3: We can look at the data for the previous years and see how the urban population has been growing. According to the UN, India's urban population in 2011 was about 31.4% of the total population. \n\nStep 4: We can assume that the urban population has been growing at a steady rate over the years. If we take the average growth rate between 2011 and 2018 (which is 3.4% per year), we can estimate the urban population in 2017 to be around 35.2% of the total population. \n\nStep 5: Finally, we can convert this percentage to the format required in the question and output the answer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 19%.",
