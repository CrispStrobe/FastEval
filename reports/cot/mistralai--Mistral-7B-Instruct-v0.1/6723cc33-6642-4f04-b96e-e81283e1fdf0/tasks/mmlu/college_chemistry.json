            "model_answer": "Optical isomerism is a phenomenon where two or more compounds have the same chemical composition but differ in their optical properties. In complexes containing achiral ligands, optical isomerism can occur due to the presence of chiral counterions or chiral solvents.\n\nLet's consider each statement one by one:\n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\n\nThis statement is false. Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism even if the ligands are not identical. For example, the complex [Fe(CN)_{4}]^{2+} is square planar and displays optical isomerism due to the presence of chiral counterions.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\n\nThis statement is false. Tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism if the ligands are chiral. For example, the complex [AlF_{4}]^{3+} is tetrahedral and displays optical isomerism due to the presence of chiral fluoride ions.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nThis statement is true. Linear complexes can display optical isomerism if the ligands are chiral. For example, the complex [Co(NO_{3})_{2}]^{2+} is linear and displays optical isomerism due to the presence of chiral nitrate ions.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n\nThis statement is false. Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism even if they have only two different ligands. For example, the complex [Mn(NO_{3})_{2}]^{2+} is octahedral and displays optical isomerism due to the presence of chiral nitrate ions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.",

In general, electronegative atoms will cause the hydrogen atom to shift downfield (towards lower frequencies) in the spectrum, while electronegative atoms will cause the hydrogen atom to shift upfield (towards higher frequencies) in the spectrum.\n\nLet's consider each compound one by one:\n\n(A) CH3F: The fluorine atom is highly electronegative, which will cause the hydrogen atom to shift downfield. The chemical shift of the hydrogen atom in CH3F is typically around 3.5 ppm. Since 1.55 kHz is approximately 0.43 ppm away from TMS (which has a chemical shift of 0 ppm), the hydrogen atom in CH3F would be expected to resonate at a frequency of approximately 3.93 ppm (3.5 ppm + 0.43 ppm).\n\n(B) CH3Cl: The chlorine atom is also highly electronegative, which will cause the hydrogen atom to shift downfield.
