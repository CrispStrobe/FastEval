            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The difference between a direct leak and a side channel is that a direct leak is a type of memory leak that occurs when a program fails to free memory that it no longer needs. This can cause the program to consume more and more memory over time, eventually leading to a denial of service.\n\nOn the other hand, a side channel is a type of leak that occurs when a program measures or observes other system features, such as timing, power usage, or space usage. This can reveal sensitive information about the program's internal state or the data it is processing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) A direct leak comes via the software system's intended interaction mechanism, where as a side channel leak comes from measurements of other system features, like timing, power usage, or space usage.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Apps developed in languages like C, C++ are prone to buffer overflow because of the following reasons:\n\n(A) No string boundary checks in predefined functions:\n\nIn C and C++, the predefined functions like `printf`, `scanf`, etc. do not have built-in checks to ensure that the input or output string does not exceed the buffer size. This can lead to buffer overflow if the input or output string is longer than the buffer size.\n\n(B) No storage check in the external memory:\n\nC and C++ allow dynamic memory allocation using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, etc. However, these functions do not have built-in checks to ensure that the allocated memory is properly deallocated when it is no longer needed. This can lead to memory leaks and buffer overflow if the memory is not properly managed.\n\n(C) No processing power check:\n\nC and C++ do not have built-in checks to ensure that the available processing power is sufficient to handle the workload. This can lead to buffer overflow if the workload exceeds the available processing power.\n\n(D) No database check:\n\nC and C++ do not have built-in checks to ensure that the database is properly managed.

If the buffer that holds the return address is overflowed with attacker-injected data, the return address can be overwritten with the address of the attacker-injected code.\n\nWhen the function returns, it will pop the overwritten return address from the stack and jump to that address.

However, the question also provides a list of options and asks for an explanation of the reasoning behind each option.\n\nOption (A) WPA2 is the most secure option among the given options. It is a standard that was developed to replace WEP and provides stronger encryption and security features. WPA2 uses a combination of AES encryption and a pre-shared key (PSK) to secure wireless networks.\n\nOption (B) WPA is an older standard that was developed to replace WEP. It provides better security than WEP but is not as secure as WPA2. WPA uses a combination of RC4 encryption and a PSK to secure wireless networks.\n\nOption (C) WPS is a standard that was developed to simplify the process of connecting devices to a wireless network. It allows devices to connect to a network without the need to enter a PSK. WPS uses a combination of EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) and a PIN to secure wireless networks.\n\nOption (D) WEP is the oldest standard among the given options. It is a weak standard that is no longer used in modern wireless networks. WEP uses a combination of RC4 encryption and a PSK to secure wireless networks, but the encryption is easily breakable and the PSK can be easily guessed.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is (A) WPA2.",
