            "question": "A 33-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of chronic pelvic pain that began after she underwent a hysterectomy 6\u00a0months ago. Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is\n\n(A) collateral estoppel\n(B) proximate cause\n(C) res ipsa loquitur\n(D) respondeat superior",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is (C) res ipsa loquitur.\n\nExplanation:\n\nRes ipsa loquitur is a legal principle that allows a court to infer negligence from the circumstances of an incident. In this case, the patient's chronic pelvic pain and the surgical sponge found in her pelvis suggest that there may have been negligence on the part of the healthcare provider who performed the hysterectomy. The fact that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence supports this inference.\n\nCollateral estoppel refers to the legal principle that a party cannot relitigate an issue that has already been decided in a prior case. While this principle may be relevant in some cases, it does not appear to apply here, as the patient's complaint and the subsequent malpractice suit are not related to a prior case.\n\nProximate cause refers to the legal principle that a cause must be sufficiently closely related to an effect in order to be considered the proximate cause. While the surgical sponge found in the patient's pelvis may be a cause of her chronic pelvic pain, it is not clear whether it is the proximate cause.\n\nResponddeat superior refers to the legal principle that an employer is liable for the actions of their employees while they are acting within the scope of their employment. While this principle may be relevant in some cases, it does not appear to apply here, as the healthcare provider who performed the hysterectomy is not an employee of the defendant in the malpractice suit.",

Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows sinus bradycardia with no evidence of ischemia. Carotid duplex ultrasonography shows reverse flow in the left vertebral artery with no evidence of occlusion.

This can lead to respiratory depression and difficulty breathing. The patient's oxygen saturation dropping to 75% and appearing cyanotic, as well as her shallow respirations, are consistent with respiratory insufficiency. \n\nWhile airway occlusion, encephalitis, and meningitis can also cause respiratory insufficiency, the patient's medical history is unremarkable and her temperature is normal, which makes these less likely causes.
