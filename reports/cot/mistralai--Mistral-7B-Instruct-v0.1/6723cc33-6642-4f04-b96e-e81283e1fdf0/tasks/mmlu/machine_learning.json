This is because the number of hidden nodes determines the complexity of the model, and thus the ability of the model to fit the training data. If the number of hidden nodes is too low, the model may be too simple and prone to underfitting. On the other hand, if the number of hidden nodes is too high, the model may be too complex and prone to overfitting. Therefore, finding the optimal number of hidden nodes is crucial for achieving good performance in a neural network.",

If the regularization coefficient is too high, the model will become too complex and overfit the data, leading to a high variance and a low bias.

This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can lead to a sparser model. On the other hand, L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term that is proportional to the absolute value of the weight.
