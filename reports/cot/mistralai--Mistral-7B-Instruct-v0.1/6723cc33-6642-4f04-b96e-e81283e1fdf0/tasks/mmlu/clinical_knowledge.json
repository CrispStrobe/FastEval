            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The blood continues to flow through the vessels between contractions of the left ventricle because the arteries have elastic recoil.\n\nThe reasoning for this answer is as follows:\n\n1. The left ventricle contracts to pump blood out of it and into the arteries.\n2. When the left ventricle contracts, it pushes blood through the arteries.\n3. However, the arteries are not completely relaxed during this process. They have some elasticity that allows them to recoil back into their original shape after the left ventricle contracts.\n4. This elastic recoil of the arteries helps to propel the blood forward and maintain blood flow through the vessels.\n5. Therefore, the arteries have elastic recoil, which allows the blood to continue flowing through the vessels between contractions of the left ventricle.\n\nThe answer is (D) the arteries have elastic recoil.",

            "model_answer": "Graves Disease of the thyroid is a condition where the immune system produces antibodies that stimulate the thyroid gland, leading to an overproduction of thyroid hormones. This can cause a range of symptoms, including weight loss, increased appetite, rapid heartbeat, and tremors.\n\nThe condition is more common in women than men, and it is not typically associated with ophthalmoplegia (a condition where the muscles that control eye movement become weak). However, Graves Disease can cause a large multi-nodular goitre (a swollen thyroid gland), which can be visible as a lump in the neck.\n\nIn the past, Graves Disease was sometimes associated with a condition called \"Derbyshire Neck,\" which is characterized by a swollen thyroid gland that extends downwards towards the chest. This condition is now rare and is typically caused by a different condition called toxic adenoma.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) It causes a large multi-nodular goitre.",

            "model_answer": "The fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise is:\n\n(C) failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. During high intensity exercise, the body's demand for ATP (adenosine triphosphate) increases rapidly.\n2. ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell and is used to power various cellular processes, including muscle contraction.\n3. The body produces ATP through a process called cellular respiration, which involves the breakdown of glucose and other molecules to release energy.\n4. However, the rate at which the body can produce ATP through cellular respiration is limited by various factors, such as the availability of oxygen, the efficiency of the respiratory chain, and the capacity of the mitochondria.\n5. When the demand for ATP exceeds the supply, the body experiences fatigue, as it cannot sustain the high intensity of activity.\n6. Therefore, the fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise is failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question asks for alterations in which neurotransmitters in the brain by pharmacological agents has been shown to influence fatigue development.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what neurotransmitters are. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that allow neurons to communicate with each other. They are released from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft, where they bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, triggering a response.\n\nNext, we need to understand what fatigue is. Fatigue is a feeling of tiredness or exhaustion that can be caused by physical or mental activity. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, lack of sleep, and certain medical conditions.\n\nNow, we need to look at the pharmacological agents that have been shown to influence fatigue development. Pharmacological agents are drugs or medications that are used to treat or prevent diseases.\n\nThere have been several studies that have investigated the role of neurotransmitters in fatigue development. One such study found that acetyl choline and noradrenaline were involved in the development of fatigue in rats. Another study found that dopamine and acetyl choline were involved in the development of fatigue in humans.\n\nAnother study found that glutamate and serotonin were involved in the development of fatigue in rats. Finally, a study found that dopamine and serotonin were involved in the development of fatigue in humans.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the alterations in which neurotransmitters in the brain by pharmacological agents has been shown to influence fatigue development are:\n\n(A) Acetyl choline and noradrenaline.\n(B) Dopamine and acetyl choline.\n(C) Glutamate and serotonin.\n(D) Dopamine and serotonin.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) Acetyl choline and noradrenaline.",

However, in general, pressure damage can take anywhere from a few hours to several days to become visible.\n\nIn this case, the patient has been on the operating table for four hours. This is a relatively short period of time, and it is possible that pressure damage may not have had enough time to develop yet. Therefore, it is likely that it will take longer than four hours for any pressure damage to be visible.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is (B) 72 hours.",

Phosphocreatine (PCr) is a high-energy molecule that is stored in muscle cells and used during intense exercise.\n2. During high-intensity exercise, PCr is rapidly broken down to release energy.\n3. After the exercise, the body needs to replenish its stores of PCr.\n4. The resynthesis of PCr involves the conversion of creatine (Cr) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) into PCr.\n5. The rate of PCr resynthesis is influenced by several factors, including the intensity and duration of the exercise, the availability of substrates (Cr and Pi), and the activity of enzymes involved in the reaction.\n6. Studies have shown that the complete resynthesis of PCr after very high intensity exercise normally takes about 4 minutes.\n7. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) about 4 minutes.",
