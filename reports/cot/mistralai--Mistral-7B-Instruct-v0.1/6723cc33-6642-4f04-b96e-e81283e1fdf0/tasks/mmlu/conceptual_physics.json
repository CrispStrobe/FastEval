            "model_answer": "General relativity is a theory of gravity proposed by Albert Einstein. It describes gravity not as a force between masses, but as the curvature of space and time caused by mass and energy.\n\n1. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, which travels at a constant speed in a vacuum, approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (or about 186,282 miles per second).\n2. According to general relativity, gravity causes a curvature of space and time. This means that the path of light, which is affected by gravity, will be curved.\n3. When light passes near a massive object like the Sun, it will be deflected from its straight path due to the curvature of space and time caused by the Sun's mass.\n4. The amount of deflection depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object and the light path.\n5. Therefore, light passing the Sun will be deflected.\n\nSince light leaving the Sun is also affected by gravity and follows a curved path, it will also be deflected. However, the deflection will be smaller than that of light passing the Sun because the light is leaving the Sun, not passing it.\n\nA clock on the Sun's surface will run slower than on Earth due to the weaker gravitational force on the Sun compared to Earth. This is known as gravitational time dilation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) All of these.",

The atomic number of an element is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus.\n2. A beta particle is a type of particle that is emitted from the nucleus of an atom and consists of a neutron and an electron.\n3. When a beta particle is emitted from an atom, the number of protons in the nucleus remains the same, as the neutron takes the place of one of the protons.\n4.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "If you change the magnetic field in a closed loop of wire, what is created in the loop is a current.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that when the magnetic field in a closed loop of wire is changed, it creates an electromotive force (emf) in the loop. This emf is due to the change in magnetic flux through the loop and is proportional to the area of the loop and the rate of change of the magnetic field.\n\nSince the loop is closed, the emf generated in the loop will cause an electric current to flow through the wire. This current is necessary to maintain the magnetic field in the loop and to generate the emf.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) current.",

When it is formed in a fusion reaction, it is created with a large amount of kinetic energy due to the conversion of mass. This kinetic energy is released as the alpha particle moves through space.\n\nThe neutron is also created in the fusion reaction, but it has less kinetic energy than the alpha particle because it has one less proton. The gamma radiation that is sometimes produced in fusion reactions is a secondary effect and does not contribute significantly to the energy release.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) kinetic energy of the alpha particle.",

The Earth's gravitational force on a satellite in orbit is not zero, but it is not strong enough to cause the satellite to accelerate or decelerate.\n3. The gravitational force on a satellite in orbit is weaker than the force at the Earth's surface because the satellite is farther away from the Earth's center of mass.\n4.
