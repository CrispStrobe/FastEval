            "model_answer": "Induction heating takes place in conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that induction heating is a method of heating a material by electromagnetic induction, which creates an electric current within the material. This current then generates heat, causing the material to warm up. Induction heating works best on materials that are good conductors of electricity, as they can easily conduct the current and generate heat. Additionally, induction heating can be used on both magnetic and non-magnetic materials, as the magnetic properties of the material do not affect the induction process. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).",

            "model_answer": "Low frequency supply is necessary for direct core type induction furnaces because magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit is poor.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that direct core type induction furnaces use a magnetic field to heat the molten metal. The magnetic field is generated by an alternating current (AC) supply, which causes the electrons in the metal to move and generate a secondary current. This secondary current then creates a magnetic field that heats the metal.\n\nHowever, the magnetic field generated by the secondary current is not as strong as the primary magnetic field. This means that there is a magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuits, which can cause problems in the induction process.\n\nLow frequency supply is necessary to reduce the magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuits. This is because the magnetic field generated by the secondary current is weaker at lower frequencies. By using a lower frequency supply, the magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuits is reduced, which allows for more efficient and effective induction heating.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit is poor.",
