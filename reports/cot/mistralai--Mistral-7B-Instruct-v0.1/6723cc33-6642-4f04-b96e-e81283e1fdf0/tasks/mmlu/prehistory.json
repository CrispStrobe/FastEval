            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The Levallois technology involved a shift in emphasis from producing core tools to producing flakes. This is because the Levallois method is a technique used to produce flakes or thin, sharp pieces of stone that can be used as tools, rather than producing larger, more robust tools like axes or hammers. The flakes produced through the Levallois method are typically smaller and more delicate than core tools, and are often used for finer tasks such as cutting or scraping. Therefore, the Levallois technology represents a shift away from the production of core tools and towards the production of flakes.",

It focuses on understanding the evolution of humans from their earliest ancestors to the present day.\n\nB) Archaeology is the study of past human societies and cultures through the excavation and analysis of their material remains. It covers a wide range of time periods and geographical areas, from prehistory to the present day.\n\nC) Primatology is the study of primates, which includes humans as well as other great apes like chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. It focuses on understanding the behavior, social structure, and cognitive abilities of these animals.\n\nD) Linguistics is the study of language and its structure, including the sounds, words, and grammar used by humans and other animals. It aims to understand how language evolves over time and how it is used to communicate ideas and emotions.\n\nBased on these definitions, we can see that the subfield of anthropology that aims to better understand the nearest living relatives of humans is (C) primatology.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The wild progenitor of maize is (C) teosinte. \n\nMaize, also known as corn, is a type of grain that is widely cultivated and consumed around the world. Its wild ancestor is teosinte, which is a type of grass that is native to Central America. Teosinte is believed to have been the progenitor of many other types of grains, including wheat, barley, and rye.\n\nThere are several different species of teosinte, but the most closely related to maize is Zea mays ssp. mexicana, which is also known as Mexican teosinte. This species is native to the highlands of central Mexico and is believed to be the direct ancestor of modern maize.\n\nOver time, maize underwent a process of domestication, during which it was selectively bred for desirable traits such as larger kernels, improved taste, and increased yield. This process took place over many centuries and involved the development of many different varieties of maize, each with its own unique characteristics.\n\nToday, maize is one of the most important crops in the world, and it is grown in many different parts of the world, including North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is used for a variety of purposes, including food, feed, and fuel.",

While this is a possibility, it is not supported by the majority of archaeological evidence. Most experts believe that cattle were domesticated much earlier, likely in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOption (B) in sub-Saharan Africa, about 8,500 years ago:\nThis option is supported by the majority of archaeological evidence. Fossilized remains of wild cattle have been found in Africa dating back to around 12,000 years ago. Domesticated cattle were likely developed from these wild ancestors through a process of selective breeding. Therefore, option (B) is the most likely answer.\n\nOption (C) in North America, about 9,500 years ago:\nThis option suggests that cattle were first domesticated in North America around 9,500 years ago. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The earliest known domesticated cattle were found in the Fertile Crescent (modern-day Iraq, Syria, Israel, and Jordan), not in North America.\n\nOption (D) in the Middle East, about 10,500 years ago:\nThis option is similar to option (C) but places the location of domestication in the Middle East rather than North America. Again, there is no evidence to support this claim. The earliest known domesticated cattle were found in the Fertile Crescent, not in the Middle East.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) in sub-Saharan Africa, about 8,500 years ago.",

Temples were also centers of learning and culture, and many of them had their own schools and libraries.\n\nTemples were often set apart from the rest of society and had their own laws and regulations.
