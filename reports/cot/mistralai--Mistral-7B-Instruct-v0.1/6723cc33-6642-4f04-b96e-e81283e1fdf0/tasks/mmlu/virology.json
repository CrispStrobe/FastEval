            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Next generation sequencing (NGS) is most often used for a variety of purposes in the field of genetics and biology. Here are some of the ways NGS is commonly used:\n\n1. Genome sequencing: NGS can be used to sequence the entire genome of an organism, including both coding and non-coding regions. This can provide valuable information about an organism's genetic makeup and can help researchers identify genetic mutations associated with diseases.\n2. Transcriptomics: NGS can be used to study the expression of genes in an organism. This can help researchers identify genes that are involved in specific biological processes or that are differentially expressed in response to different conditions.\n3. Metagenomics: NGS can be used to study the genetic diversity of microbial communities in a given environment. This can help researchers identify new species and understand the ecological interactions between different organisms.\n4. Phylogenetics: NGS can be used to study the evolutionary relationships between different organisms. This can help researchers understand the history of life on Earth and the processes that have shaped the diversity of life.\n\nBased on these uses, the correct answer is (A) To identify a newly discovered virus.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for which of the following?\n\n(A) Placebo effect: Randomization helps to ensure that the placebo group and the treatment group are similar in terms of their characteristics, which can help to minimize the placebo effect. The placebo effect is the phenomenon where a person experiences an improvement in their symptoms or health, even though they have received a treatment that has no therapeutic effect. By randomly assigning subjects to either the placebo or treatment group, researchers can help to ensure that any observed differences between the two groups are due to the treatment itself, rather than the placebo effect.\n\n(B) Recall bias: Recall bias occurs when people's memories of past events are influenced by their current beliefs or expectations. In a clinical trial, recall bias can occur if subjects in one group are more likely to remember certain events or symptoms than subjects in another group. Randomization can help to minimize recall bias by ensuring that the groups are similar in terms of their characteristics and experiences.\n\n(C) Non-compliance: Non-compliance occurs when subjects do not follow the instructions or protocol of a clinical trial. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as forgetfulness, lack of motivation, or side effects. Randomization can help to minimize non-compliance by ensuring that the groups are similar in terms of their willingness and ability to comply with the trial protocol.\n\n(D) Effect modification (interaction): Effect modification occurs when the effect of a treatment on a particular outcome is influenced by the presence of other factors. In a clinical trial, effect modification can occur if the treatment has a different effect on different subgroups of subjects, based on their characteristics or experiences. Randomization can help to identify effect modification by ensuring that the groups are similar in terms of their characteristics and experiences, and by allowing researchers to analyze the data for interactions between the treatment and other factors.\n\nIn conclusion, randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for the placebo effect.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The coronavirus that has caused thousands of deaths around the world as an 'emergent' virus is (B) SARS.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. An 'emergent' virus is a new or recently discovered virus that poses a significant public health threat.\n2. The four coronaviruses listed in the question (MERS, SARS, OC43, and HKU1) are all known to cause illness in humans.\n3. However, only one of these viruses has been identified as causing thousands of deaths around the world.\n4. SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) was first identified in China in 2003 and quickly spread to other countries, causing a global pandemic. It is estimated to have caused several thousand deaths worldwide.\n5. MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) is another coronavirus that has caused significant illness and death, but its impact has been more localized to the Middle East and North Africa.\n6. OC43 and HKU1 are two common coronaviruses that cause the common cold. While they can cause serious illness in some people, they have not been associated with the same level of mortality as SARS.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the correct answer is (B) SARS.",

            "model_answer": "The special feature of adaptive immunity is (B) Ability to distinguish self and non self.\n\nAdaptive immunity is a type of immune response that is specific to a particular pathogen or antigen. It involves the activation of immune cells called lymphocytes, which are able to recognize and attack the pathogen.\n\nOne of the key features of adaptive immunity is its ability to distinguish self and non-self. This means that the immune system is able to recognize and attack foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, while leaving the body's own cells and tissues unharmed.\n\nThis ability to distinguish self and non-self is achieved through a process called antigen presentation. Antigens are molecules that are unique to a particular pathogen and are presented to the immune system by specialized cells called dendritic cells. The immune system is then able to recognize and attack the antigen, leading to the activation of the adaptive immune response.\n\nTherefore, the special feature of adaptive immunity is (B) Ability to distinguish self and non self.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question. The question asks which of the options can most often prevent diseases.\n\nStep 2: Consider each option.\n- Vaccines are substances that are introduced into the body to stimulate the immune system and prevent infection by a specific disease. They are effective in preventing many infectious diseases, such as measles, polio, and hepatitis B.\n- Antivirals are medications that can treat viral infections. They work by inhibiting the replication of viral particles or by boosting the immune system's response to the infection. Antivirals are effective in treating some viral infections, such as HIV and influenza.\n- Hygiene refers to practices that help prevent the spread of disease, such as washing hands, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and avoiding close contact with sick people. Hygiene practices can help prevent many types of infections, including respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.\n- Mosquito nets can help prevent malaria, a disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite and transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. Mosquito nets can help prevent malaria by creating a physical barrier between the sleeper and the mosquito, reducing the risk of being bitten by an infected mosquito.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the options. All of the options listed can help prevent diseases to some extent. However, vaccines are the most effective in preventing many infectious diseases, and they are widely used to protect public health. Antivirals can be effective in treating some viral infections, but they do not prevent them. Hygiene practices can help prevent many types of infections, but they require consistent effort and may not be effective in preventing all types of infections. Mosquito nets are effective in preventing malaria, but they may not be effective in preventing other types of diseases.\n\nStep 4: Choose the best option. Based on the evaluation in step 3, vaccines are the most effective in preventing diseases.\n\nThe answer is (A) Vaccines.",

The initial case-control study found a strong association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer (OR = 2.5).\n2. However, when the study subjects were divided into smokers and non-smokers, no association was found between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within either group.\n3. This suggests that smoking may be a confounding factor in the relationship between alcohol consumption and lung cancer.\n4. Confounding occurs when a third variable (in this case, smoking) affects both the exposure (alcohol consumption) and the outcome (lung cancer).\n5. Without controlling for confounding factors, it is difficult to accurately determine the true association between the exposure and outcome.\n6.
