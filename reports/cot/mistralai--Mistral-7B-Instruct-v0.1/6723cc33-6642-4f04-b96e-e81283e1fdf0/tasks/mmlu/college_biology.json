            "model_answer": "Mycorrhizal fungi confer several benefits to many plants. \n\nFirstly, they help plants absorb water by extending the root system into the soil. This allows plants to access more water and nutrients, which is particularly important in dry habitats. \n\nSecondly, mycorrhizal fungi fix nitrogen in the soil, which is particularly important for plants in nitrogen-limited habitats. This helps plants grow and develop more efficiently. \n\nThirdly, mycorrhizal fungi provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils. This helps plants grow and develop more efficiently. \n\nFinally, mycorrhizal fungi provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen. This helps plants grow and develop more efficiently, as they can use the carbon to produce energy and grow. \n\nBased on these benefits, the correct answer is (D) They provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen.",

The correct statement about the Golgi apparatus is:\n\n(C) Its composite flattened cisternae are continuous with one another.\n\nThe Golgi apparatus is composed of a stack of flattened cisternae, which are membrane-bound compartments that contain enzymes and other molecules involved in protein and lipid modification. The cisternae are arranged in a stack, with the cis face (the face closest to the endoplasmic reticulum) at the top and the trans face (the face furthest from the endoplasmic reticulum) at the bottom. The cisternae are continuous with one another, meaning that they are connected by narrow channels called intercisternal bridges. This continuity allows for the smooth flow of material between the cisternae and enables the Golgi apparatus to function efficiently as a modifying and sorting organelle.",

A competitive inhibitor is a molecule that competes with the substrate for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site.\n2. This type of inhibition is reversible, meaning that the inhibitor can be removed from the system and the enzyme can continue to function normally.\n3. The inhibitor binds to the enzyme's active site, but not as tightly as the substrate does. This allows the inhibitor to be easily displaced by the substrate when it binds to the enzyme.\n4. The inhibition is competitive because the inhibitor and substrate are competing for the same enzyme, but they are binding to different sites on the enzyme.\n5. Therefore, the answer is (C).",
