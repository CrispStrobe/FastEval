This means that if we double the number of bacteria, the population will also double in size.\n3. The initial population is 200, and it triples in 10 hours.\n4. To find out how many times the population has tripled, we divide the final population by the initial population: 200 / 200 = 1.\n5.

To do this, we divide the total number of hours in a day by the number of hours it took for the population to triple once: 24 / 10 = 2.4.\n7. Since the population will triple 2.4 times in one day, we can calculate the final population by multiplying the population after 10 hours (600) by 2.4: 600 x 2.4 = 1440.\n\nTherefore, the approximate number of bacteria after 1 full day is (B) 1440.",

            "model_answer": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Let's call the number of pins John originally had \"x\".\n2. John divided his pins into two equal piles, so he had x/2 pins in each pile.\n3. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile, which is (1/3)/2 = 1/6 of the pins.\n4. So, John gave away x/2 * 1/6 = x/12 pins.\n5. After giving away these pins, John had x/2 - x/12 = x/24 pins left in his pile.\n6. We know that John had 66 pins left, so x/24 = 66.\n7. Solving for x, we get x = 66 * 24 = 1592.\n\nTherefore, John originally had 1592 pins.\n\n(A) 792 is incorrect because it is not equal to 1592.\n(B) 66 is incorrect because it is not equal to 1592.\n(C) 396 is incorrect because it is not equal to 1592.\n(D) 72 is incorrect because it is not equal to 1592.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) 792.",
