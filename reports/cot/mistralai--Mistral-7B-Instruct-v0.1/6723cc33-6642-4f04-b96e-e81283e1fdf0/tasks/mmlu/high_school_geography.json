            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the countries is least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry, we need to compare their levels of resource extraction and consumption with their domestic reserves.\n\n1. The United States is one of the world's largest producers of oil, natural gas, coal, and other minerals. It also has significant reserves of these resources. Therefore, the US is relatively self-sufficient in terms of natural resources.\n\n2. Japan is heavily reliant on imports for its energy needs, particularly oil and natural gas. While it has some domestic reserves of coal and iron ore, Japan's overall resource base is limited.\n\n3. France has a mix of domestic and imported resources, including oil, natural gas, coal, and minerals. However, it is not as self-sufficient as the US in terms of resource extraction and consumption.\n\n4. The United Kingdom has a significant amount of domestic oil and natural gas reserves, but it is also heavily reliant on imports for some resources, such as coal and iron ore.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that Japan is the least self-sufficient among the given countries in terms of natural resources needed for modern industry.\n\n(J)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The information initially travels through a process known as (C) innovative diffusion.\n\nInnovative diffusion is a process where new ideas, products, or technologies are introduced and spread through a society. It is characterized by the creation of new ideas and the adoption of those ideas by individuals or groups. In the case of a new fashion design, it is likely that the designer or company introducing the design will first release it to the public and then encourage others to adopt and wear it. This process of innovation and adoption can spread quickly through social networks and media, leading to the widespread popularity of the new design.",

            "model_answer": "Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation suggests that the initial advantage of a region can lead to further advantages, which in turn attract more resources and lead to even more advantages. This process is self-reinforcing and can lead to a significant gap between regions.\n\nThe statement (A) contradicts this theory by suggesting that wealth is distributed equally through trade between developed and developing regions. This implies that there is no initial advantage for any region, which is not supported by Myrdal's theory.\n\nThe statement (B) suggests that the core will always dominate the periphery, which is also not supported by Myrdal's theory. Myrdal's theory suggests that the initial advantage of a region can lead to further advantages, but it does not imply that the core will always dominate the periphery.\n\nThe statement (C) suggests that the growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery, which is supported by Myrdal's theory. Myrdal's theory suggests that the initial advantage of a region can lead to further advantages, which in turn attract more resources and lead to even more advantages.\n\nThe statement (D) suggests that regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade, which is supported by Myrdal's theory.

The benefits of agglomeration include increased productivity, lower costs, and improved access to markets and services.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) agglomeration.",
