In this case, we can generate the language by starting with the empty stack and pushing 0 or 1 onto the stack, depending on the current symbol w. We can then pop the top symbol off the stack and push it onto the stack again, along with any additional 0 or 1 symbols that are required to generate the next symbol in the input string.

            "model_answer": "A starvation-free job-scheduling policy guarantees that no job waits indefinitely for service. This means that all jobs will eventually be executed, regardless of their priority or arrival time.\n\nTo determine which job-scheduling policy is starvation-free, we need to consider how each policy handles the execution of jobs.\n\n(A) Round-robin: In a round-robin scheduling policy, each job is given a fixed amount of time to execute. After that time has elapsed, the next job is executed, and the process repeats. This policy ensures that all jobs are eventually executed, but it does not guarantee that no job waits indefinitely for service. Therefore, (A) is not a starvation-free job-scheduling policy.\n\n(B) Priority queuing: In a priority queuing scheduling policy, jobs are executed based on their priority level. Jobs with higher priority levels are executed first, and jobs with lower priority levels are executed later. This policy ensures that all jobs are eventually executed, but it does not guarantee that no job waits indefinitely for service. Therefore, (B) is not a starvation-free job-scheduling policy.\n\n(C) Shortest job first: In a shortest job first scheduling policy, jobs are executed based on their duration. Jobs with shorter durations are executed first, and jobs with longer durations are executed later. This policy ensures that all jobs are eventually executed, but it does not guarantee that no job waits indefinitely for service. Therefore, (C) is not a starvation-free job-scheduling policy.\n\n(D) Youngest job first: In a youngest job first scheduling policy, jobs are executed based on their arrival time. Jobs that arrived more recently are executed first, and jobs that arrived earlier are executed later. This policy ensures that all jobs are eventually executed, but it does not guarantee that no job waits indefinitely for service. Therefore, (D) is not a starvation-free job-scheduling policy.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the job-scheduling policies (A), (B), (C), or (D) are starvation-free.",
