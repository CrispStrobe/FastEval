            "model_answer": "In their study of depression, Brown & Harris (1978) found that:\n\n(A) women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support. This means that women who have a strong support system are less likely to experience depression when exposed to stressors.\n\n(B) self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent. This suggests that men and people from higher socioeconomic backgrounds may be more likely to report feeling depressed.\n\n(C) men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression. This means that the prevalence of depression is roughly the same for men and women, although the specific symptoms and experiences of depression may differ between the genders.\n\n(D) men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles. This theory suggests that societal expectations and norms around gender roles can contribute to men feeling more pressure to suppress their emotions and seek help less often, which can increase their risk of experiencing depression.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

This is a well-established form of community that has existed for centuries.\n\nOption B describes gay villages, which are formed in certain parts of large cities. This is a relatively new form of community that has emerged in recent decades as a result of social and cultural changes.\n\nOption C describes sociological communities, formed by unpopular lecturers. This is a very specific and narrow form of community that is based on shared academic interests and experiences.\n\nOption D describes virtual communities that exist only in cyberspace. This is a relatively new form of community that has emerged with the rise of the internet and digital technology.\n\nTherefore, the option that is not identified as a new form of community is option C, sociological communities, formed by unpopular lecturers.",

One of the key ideas in this theory is that capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority. This means that the traditional capitalist class, which owns the means of production and earns profits from it, is being replaced by a new class of managers who are paid salaries and have more bureaucratic authority. This shift in power is seen as a key factor in the changing class structure and the emergence of a new social order.",

            "model_answer": "The patterns of drug use in Britain reveal that:\n\n(A) it has increased and is no longer confined to a hedonistic youth subculture.\n\nThis is because drug use has become more widespread and accepted in society, with people using drugs for various reasons such as stress, anxiety, and social bonding. Additionally, the availability and accessibility of drugs have increased, making it easier for people to experiment with different substances.\n\n(B) the most commonly used recreational drug is Ecstasy.\n\nEcstasy, also known as MDMA, is a popular drug among young people in Britain. It is often used for its stimulating effects, which can include increased energy, euphoria, and heightened sensory perceptions. Ecstasy is also relatively easy to obtain and can be taken orally, making it a popular choice for recreational use.\n\n(C) teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys.\n\nResearch has shown that teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs such as cocaine and heroin than teenage boys. This may be due to a variety of factors, including social pressure, peer influence, and a desire for novel experiences.\n\n(D) despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is very rare.\n\nWhile drug use is still a significant problem in Britain, the use of illegal drugs has actually decreased in recent years. This may be due to increased awareness and education about the dangers of drug use, as well as stricter enforcement of drug laws. However, it is important to note that drug use is still a serious issue and should not be taken lightly.",

            "model_answer": "The reasoning behind this question is to determine the factor that led to the greatest proportion of housework done by men, as suggested by Sullivan's (2000) study. The four options provided are potential explanations for this phenomenon.\n\nOption (A) suggests that the proportion of housework men did was greatest when they had rediscovered themselves as 'new men'. This could mean that they had undergone a personal transformation or change in their self-perception, which led them to take on more household tasks. However, this option does not provide any concrete evidence to support this claim.\n\nOption (B) suggests that the proportion of housework men did was greatest when their wives were at home and nagged them all the time. This could mean that men were more likely to take on household tasks when their wives were present and pressuring them to do so. However, this option also does not provide any concrete evidence to support this claim.\n\nOption (C) suggests that the proportion of housework men did was greatest when exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron were invented. This could mean that men were more likely to take on household tasks when they had access to new and innovative tools to make the job easier. However, this option does not provide any concrete evidence to support this claim.\n\nOption (D) suggests that the proportion of housework men did was greatest when they were unemployed or both partners worked full time. This could mean that when men were not working, they had more time and energy to take on household tasks. Additionally, when both partners worked full time, there may have been less pressure on men to take on household tasks. However, this option provides the most concrete evidence to support the claim, as it is based on empirical data and research.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

In the context of feminism, a standpoint refers to the perspective that feminist theory and practice should be grounded in the experiences and concerns of women. This means that feminist research and analysis should be conducted from a woman's perspective, rather than from a male perspective.\n\nFeminist theory recognizes that women's experiences are often different from men's experiences, and that these differences are shaped by gender inequality. Therefore, a feminist standpoint requires that researchers and activists pay attention to the issues that are neglected by mainstream feminism, such as the experiences of women of color, women with disabilities, and women in non-traditional roles.\n\nTaking a stand on these issues means advocating for policies and practices that address the specific needs and concerns of these marginalized groups. It also means challenging the dominant narratives and power structures that perpetuate gender inequality and marginalize women.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",
