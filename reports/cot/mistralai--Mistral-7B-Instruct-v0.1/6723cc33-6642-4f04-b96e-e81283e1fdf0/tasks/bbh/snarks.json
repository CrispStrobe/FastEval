The statement (A) is describing a situation where a person's bike wheel is wobbling several millimeters in either direction.\n2. This is not an unusual occurrence and would not typically be considered unsafe.\n3. However, the statement is presented in a sarcastic tone, suggesting that the bike is actually very unsafe despite the small wobble in the wheel.\n4. The use of the word \"several\" to describe the wobble also adds to the sarcasm, as it implies that the wobble is much larger than it actually is.\n5. Therefore, the statement (A) is sarcastic.",
