In English, adjectives typically come before the noun they modify, and adverbs typically come after the verb they modify.\n\nIn sentence (A), \"enormous\" and \"circular\" are both adjectives that modify the noun \"dog\". However, \"enormous\" is an adjective that describes the size of the dog, while \"circular\" is an adjective that describes the shape of the dog. Adjectives that describe size should come before adjectives that describe shape, so the correct order would be \"enormous circular dog\".\n\nIn sentence (B), \"enormous\" and \"circular\" are also both adjectives that modify the noun \"dog\". However, the order of the adjectives is reversed, with \"enormous\" coming after \"circular\". This is incorrect because adjectives that describe size should come before adjectives that describe shape. Therefore, sentence (B) is incorrect.\n\nThe correct sentence is (A) \"enormous circular dog\".",
