The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\n\nFrom points 2 and 3, we can infer that the falcon must be to the right of the quail as well.\n\nNow let's consider the different options:\n\nOption (A): The blue jay is the second from the left.\nThis option doesn't provide any information about the position of the quail or the falcon. Since we already know that the falcon is to the right of the blue jay, this option cannot be correct.\n\nOption (B): The quail is the second from the left.\nThis option tells us that the quail is to the left of the blue jay, which contradicts the fact that the blue jay is to the right of the quail. Therefore, this option cannot be correct.\n\nOption (C): The falcon is the second from the left.\nThis option tells us that the falcon is to the left of the blue jay, which contradicts the fact that the falcon is to the right of the blue jay. Therefore, this option cannot be correct.\n\nSince none of the options provide a consistent arrangement of the birds, we need to reconsider our approach. Let's try arranging the birds based on their relationships:\n\n1. The blue jay is to the right of the quail.\n2. The falcon is to the right of the blue jay.\n\nFrom these relationships, we can infer that the falcon must be to the right of the quail as well.\n\nNow let's arrange the birds in this order:\n\n1.
