Since the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, we can write the date as 1/1/2019.\n3. To find the date 24 days later, we add 24 days to the first day of 2019.\n4. Adding 24 days to 1/1/2019 gives us 1/25/2019.\n5. Therefore, the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY is 1/25/2019.\n\nThe answer is (D) 01/08/2019.",

We can then compare the resulting date with the date of their marriage to determine the anniversary date.\n\nFirst, let's find the current date. We can do this by using the current date and time in our computer's system clock. For example, if the current date and time is January 2, 2022, 10:00 AM, then the current date in MM/DD/YYYY format would be 01/02/2022.\n\nNext, we need to subtract 5 years from the current date. To do this, we can subtract 5 from the year value (YYYY) and keep the month and day values the same. For example, if the current date is 01/02/2022, then the date 5 years ago would be 01/02/2017.\n\nNow that we have the anniversary date, we can compare it with the options given in the question.
