We can use the filter() function in Python to do this.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the height and weight columns from strings to integers. We can use the int() function to do this.\n\nThen, we can use the filter() function to create a new list of penguins that meet the two conditions. We can use the lambda function to define the filter criteria.\n\nFinally, we can count the number of penguins in the new list using the len() function.\n\nHere's the code to do this:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# create the table as a pandas DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'name': ['Louis', 'Bernard', 'Vincent', 'Gwen'],\n                   'age': [7, 5, 9, 8],\n                   'height (cm)': ['50', '80', '60', '70'],\n                   'weight (kg)': [11, 13, 11, 15]})\n\n# convert the height and weight columns to integers\ndf['height (cm)'] = df['height (cm)'].apply(int)\ndf['weight (kg)'] = df['weight (kg)'].apply(int)\n\n# add a new penguin to the table\ndf = df.append({'name': 'James', 'age': 12, 'height (cm)': 90, 'weight (kg)': 12}, ignore_index=True)\n\n# delete the penguin named Bernard from the table\ndf = df.drop(df[df['name'] == 'Bernard'].index, axis=0)\n\n# filter the table based on age and weight\nfiltered_df = df[(df['age'] < 8) & (df['weight (kg)'] < 12)]\n\n# count the number of penguins in the filtered list\nnum_penguins = len(filtered_df)\n\n# output the answer\nprint(num_penguins)\n```\nThe output of this code will be:\n```\n1\n```\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 1.",
