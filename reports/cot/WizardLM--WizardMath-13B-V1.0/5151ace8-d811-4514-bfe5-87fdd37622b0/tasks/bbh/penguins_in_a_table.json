We can see that there are four different types of data points: name, age, height in centimeters, and weight in kilograms. \n\nNow, let's analyze the given answer choices. Choices A, B, C, and D all assume that the number of species is equal to the number of columns in the table. However, this is not necessarily true. We need to consider all possible combinations of data points to determine the number of species.\n\n1. For the first data point (Louis), we have the following combinations:\n   - (Name, Age, Height, Weight)\n   - (Name, Age, Height, Weight)\n   - (Name, Age, Height, Weight)\n\n2. For the second data point (Bernard), we have the following combinations:\n   - (Name, Age, Height, Weight)\n   - (Name, Age, Height, Weight)\n   - (Name, Age, Height, Weight)\n   - (Name, Age, Height, Weight)\n\n3. For the third data point (Vincent), we have the following combinations:\n   - (Name, Age, Height, Weight)\n   - (Name, Age, Height, Weight)\n   - (Name, Age, Height, Weight)\n   - (Name, Age, Height, Weight)\n   - (Name, Age, Height, Weight)\n\n4.
