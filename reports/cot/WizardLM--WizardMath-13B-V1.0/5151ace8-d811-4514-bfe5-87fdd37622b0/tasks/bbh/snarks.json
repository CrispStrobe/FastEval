            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the context of the statement. The statement is in response to a proposal to get rid of trams and replace them with either carriages or lightrail. \n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nOption A: \"Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build carriages instead.\"\nIn this scenario, we are replacing the trams with carriages. Carriages are a type of transportation that is typically pulled by horses or other animals. This means that we would need to have these animals available and ready to pull the carriages. Additionally, the infrastructure for the carriages would be different from the existing tram infrastructure, which could lead to additional costs and disruptions.\n\nOption B: \"Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build lightrail instead.\"\nIn this scenario, we are replacing the trams with lightrail. Lightrail is a type of rail transportation that is powered by electricity. This means that we would need to have the infrastructure in place to support the lightrail, such as power lines and stations. However, the infrastructure for the lightrail could potentially be more efficient and cost-effective than the existing tram infrastructure.\n\nNow, let's consider the tone of each statement:\n\nOption A: \"Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build carriages instead.\"\nThe tone of this statement is somewhat sarcastic, as it suggests that the idea of building carriages is absurd and not practical in the modern world. The use of the word \"yeah\" also implies that the person making the statement is not taking the proposal seriously.\n\nOption B: \"Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build lightrail instead.\"\nThe tone of this statement is more serious and less sarcastic than Option A. It acknowledges the proposal to get rid of the trams and suggests a more practical and modern alternative, which is lightrail. The use of the word \"yeah\" here does not imply that the person making the statement is not taking the proposal seriously.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement that is not sarcastic is Option B: \"Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build lightrail instead.\" The answer is: Option B.\n\nThe answer is: Option B.",
