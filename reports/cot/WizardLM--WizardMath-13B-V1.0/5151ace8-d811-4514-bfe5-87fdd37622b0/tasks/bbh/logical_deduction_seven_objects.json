The pears are more expensive than the plums.\n4. The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis.\n5. The mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n6. The peaches are the second-cheapest.\n\nNow, let's analyze these statements one by one:\n\n1. Since the pears are the third-cheapest, it means that there are two cheaper fruits than pears. We can eliminate options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) as the most expensive fruit.\n\n2. The kiwis are the second-most expensive, which means there is only one fruit more expensive than the kiwis. We can eliminate option (F) as the most expensive fruit.\n\n3. The pears are more expensive than the plums. This means that the plums are the cheapest fruit. We can eliminate options (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) as the cheapest fruit.\n\n4. The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis. This means that the kiwis are the second-most expensive fruit. We can eliminate options (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) as the second-most expensive fruit.\n\n5. The mangoes are the third-most expensive. We can eliminate options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) as the third-most expensive fruit.\n\n6. The peaches are the second-cheapest. We can eliminate options (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) as the second-cheapest fruit.\n\nNow, we are left with the following information:\n\n- The pears are the third-cheapest.\n- The kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n- The plums are the fourth-most expensive.\n- The oranges are the fourth-most expensive.\n- The mangoes are the third-most expensive.\n- The peaches are the second-cheapest.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that the fourth-most expensive fruit is the mangoes.

Ada finished below Dan.\n   - Since Ada finished below Dan, we know that Dan is in one of the positions 1 to 5 (excluding Ada's position).\n\n5. Ana finished third.\n   - This statement doesn't give us any new information about the positions of the golfers, as Ana's position is already known from the previous statements.\n\nNow, let's analyze the positions of the golfers based on the given information:\n\n- Rob is in the 7th position.\n- Ada is in one of the positions 1 to 6 (excluding Rob's position).\n- Eve is in one of the positions 2 to 6 (excluding Rob's position and Ada's position).\n- Mel is in one of the positions 1 to 5 (excluding Eli's position and Ada's position).\n- Eli is in the 6th position.\n- Dan is in one of the positions 1 to 5 (excluding Ada's position).\n- Ana is in the 3rd position.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that the only possible order that satisfies all the statements is:\n\nAna -> Eli -> Mel -> Dan -> Rob -> Ada -> Eve\n\nThus, the answer is: Eve finished first.\n\nThe answer is: Eve finished first.",

Rob finished below Joe.\n\nLet's analyze the statements one by one:\n\nStatement 1: Dan finished third. - This statement tells us that Dan's finishing position is exactly three positions ahead of the last position (Amy's position). So, Dan's position is 3rd.\n\nStatement 2: Ana finished above Ada. - This statement tells us that Ana's finishing position is greater than Ada's finishing position.

So, Ada's position is either 4th or 5th.\n\nStatement 3: Amy finished last. - This statement tells us that Amy's finishing position is the last position, which is 7th.\n\nStatement 4: Dan finished below Rob. - This statement tells us that Dan's finishing position is greater than Rob's finishing position. Since we know Dan's position (3rd) and Rob's position is below Dan's, we can deduce that Rob's position is either 2nd or 1st.\n\nStatement 5: Eve finished below Ada. - This statement tells us that Eve's finishing position is greater than Ada's finishing position.

Since we know Rob's position (1st or 2nd) and Joe's position is below Rob's, we can deduce that Joe's position is either 3rd or 4th.\n\nNow, let's combine all the information:\n\n1. Dan: 3rd\n2.
