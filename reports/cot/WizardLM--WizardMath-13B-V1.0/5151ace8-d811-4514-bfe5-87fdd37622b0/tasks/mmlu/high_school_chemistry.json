            "question": "A sample of a compound known to consist of only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen is found to have a total mass of 29.05 g.

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the given information\nWe are given the total mass of the compound (29.05 g), the mass of the carbon (18.02 g), and the mass of the hydrogen (3.03 g). We need to find the empirical formula of the compound.\n\nStep 2: Determine the mass of the oxygen\nTo find the mass of the oxygen, we can subtract the mass of the carbon and hydrogen from the total mass of the compound:\n\nMass of oxygen = Total mass - Mass of carbon - Mass of hydrogen\nMass of oxygen = 29.05 g - 18.02 g - 3.03 g\nMass of oxygen = 7.0 g\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average atomic mass of the oxygen\nNow that we know the mass of the oxygen, we can find the average atomic mass of the oxygen. Since oxygen has an atomic mass of 16, we can calculate the average atomic mass of the oxygen as follows:\n\nAverage atomic mass of oxygen = Mass of oxygen / Atomic mass of oxygen\nAverage atomic mass of oxygen = 7.0 g / 16\nAverage atomic mass of oxygen = 0.4125\n\nStep 4: Determine the empirical formula\nSince the empirical formula is a ratio of the atoms in the compound, we can use the average atomic mass of the oxygen to find the empirical formula. We can assume that the oxygen is combined with one carbon and one hydrogen atom, as the given masses suggest. Therefore, the empirical formula will be in the form CxHyOz.\n\nTo find the values of x, y, and z, we can use the average atomic mass of oxygen:\n\nx + y + z = total mass\nx + y + 0.4125 = 29.05\n\nStep 5: Solve for x, y, and z\nNow, we can solve for x, y, and z:\n\nx + y = 28.6375\nx = 28.6375 - y\n\nSince x and y represent the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms, respectively, x and y must be integers. We can try different integer values for y and see which one gives us a valid empirical formula.\n\nIf y = 1, then x = 28.6375 - 1 = 27.6375, which is not an integer.\nIf y = 2, then x = 28.6375 - 2 = 26.6375, which is not an integer.\nIf y = 3, then x = 28.6375 - 3 = 25.6375, which is not an integer.\nIf y = 4, then x = 28.6375 - 4 = 24.6375, which is not an integer.\nIf y = 5, then x = 28.6375 - 5 = 23.6375, which is not an integer.\nIf y = 6, then x = 28.6375 - 6 = 22.6375, which is not an integer.\nIf y = 7, then x = 28.6375 - 7 = 21.6375, which is not an integer.\nIf y = 8, then x = 28.6375 - 8 = 20.6375, which is not an integer.\nIf y = 9, then x = 28.6375 - 9 = 19.6375, which is not an integer.\nIf y = 10, then x = 28.6375 - 10 = 18.6375, which is not an integer.\n\nSince none of the integer values for y give us a valid empirical formula, we can conclude that the given information is not sufficient to determine the empirical formula of the compound. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(E) Not enough information\n\nThe answer is: Not enough information.",

The Gibbs free energy is a measure of the useful work that can be obtained from a system at a given temperature. A negative \u0394G indicates that the reaction is favorable, and it will proceed to form more products.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) At equilibrium, the number of products and reactants is equal.
