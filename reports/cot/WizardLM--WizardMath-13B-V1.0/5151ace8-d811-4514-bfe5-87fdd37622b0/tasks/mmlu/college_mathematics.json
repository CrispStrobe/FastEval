To do this, we need to find the circle that is tangent to the parabola. A tangent circle touches the parabola at exactly one point.\n\nStep 4: Identify the circle that is tangent to the parabola\nSince the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, we can focus on the circle with its center at the focus of the parabola, which is (0, 4).

This means that the square of P is equal to P itself.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of P^2 = P\nIf P^2 = P, then P must be a idempotent transformation, which means that P is both its own input and output. In other words, P(P(x)) = P(x) for all x in V.\n\nStep 3: Determine the range of P\nSince P is idempotent, the range of P (the set of all possible outputs of P) must be a subset of the domain of P (the set of all possible inputs of P). In other words, if P(x) = P(y) for some x and y in V, then x = y. This is because P is both its own input and output.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the implications of the range of P\nIf the range of P is a subset of the domain of P, then P must map each vector in V to itself. In other words, P is a constant transformation, where the constant is the vector it maps to.\n\nStep 5: Determine the form of P\nSince P is a constant transformation, it must be either the identity transformation (which maps each vector to itself) or the zero transformation (which maps all vectors to the zero vector).\n\nStep 6: Analyze the diagonalizability of P\nIf P is the identity transformation, then it is diagonalizable, as every linear transformation can be diagonalized.
