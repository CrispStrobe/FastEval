            "question": "Bariatric surgery is used for obesity treatment but how much is the incidence of type 2 diabetes reduced in obese individuals after surgery?\n\n\n(A) 80-90%\n(B) No reduction in the incidence\n(C) Approximately 50 %\n(D) None of the options given is correct",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes. Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and losing weight can help reduce the risk of developing the disease.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) 80-90%: This option suggests that after bariatric surgery, there is a reduction of 80-90% in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals. However, this claim is not supported by the question or the given options.\n\n(B) No reduction in the incidence: This option states that there is no reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery. This claim is also not supported by the question or the given options.\n\n(C) Approximately 50 %: This option suggests that there is a reduction of approximately 50% in the incidence of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery. This claim is more plausible, as it is in line with the known relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\n(D) None of the options given is correct: This option states that none of the given options are correct. However, we have already analyzed the options and found that option (C) is the most plausible.\n\nAfter considering the given options and analyzing the relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes, we can conclude that the incidence of type 2 diabetes is reduced by approximately 50% in obese individuals after bariatric surgery. Therefore, the correct option is (C).\n\nThe answer is: the incidence of type 2 diabetes is reduced by approximately 50% in obese individuals after bariatric surgery.",
