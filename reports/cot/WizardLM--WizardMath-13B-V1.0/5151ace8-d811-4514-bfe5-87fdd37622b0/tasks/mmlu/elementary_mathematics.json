            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the given distance between Miriam's house and Debbie's house, which is 444.44 meters. This distance can be represented as a decimal: 444.44. The decimal has four digits, with the first digit being 4, the second digit being 4, the third digit being 4, and the fourth digit being 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements one by one:\n\n(A) The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.\nTo check this statement, we need to find the value of the 4 in the tens place. Since the distance is 444.44 meters, the value of the 4 in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40. Now, we need to find the value of the 4 in the tenths place. Since the value of the 4 in the tens place is 40, the value of the 4 in the tenths place is 40 / 10 = 4. Therefore, statement (A) is true.\n\n(B) The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place.\nTo check this statement, we need to find the value of the 4 in the ones place. Since the distance is 444.44 meters, the value of the 4 in the ones place is 4 * 1 = 4. Now, we need to find the value of the 4 in the hundredths place. Since the value of the 4 in the ones place is 4, the value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 4 / 10 = 0.4. Therefore, statement (B) is true.\n\n(C) The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place.\nTo check this statement, we need to find the value of the 4 in the hundreds place. Since the distance is 444.44 meters, the value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 4 * 100 = 400. Now, we need to find the value of the 4 in the ones place. Since the value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 400, the value of the 4 in the ones place is 400 / 100 = 4. Therefore, statement (C) is false.\n\n(D) The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place.\nTo check this statement, we already found the value of the 4 in the hundredths place in statement (B). The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 0.4. Now, we need to find the value of the 4 in the tenths place. Since the value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 0.4, the value of the 4 in the tenths place is 0.4 * 10 = 4. Therefore, statement (D) is true.\n\nIn conclusion, the true statements are (A), (B), and (D). The final answer is: 444.44 meters.\n\nThe answer is: \\text{(A), (B), \\& (D)}.",
