            "model_answer": "To determine the most prevalent mental disorder in the world, we need to consider the available data and research. The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes a list of the top 10 causes of disability worldwide, which includes both physical and mental disorders. \n\nFor the year 2010, the WHO reported the following as the leading causes of disability worldwide:\n\n1. Low back pain\n2. Major depressive disorder\n3. Asthma\n4. Hearing loss\n5. Migraine\n6. Neck pain\n7. Abdominal pain\n8. Dermatitis\n9. Anxiety disorders\n10. Diabetes mellitus\n\nBased on this data, we can see that anxiety disorders are the ninth most prevalent cause of disability worldwide. While this does not provide an exact prevalence rate, it suggests that anxiety disorders are more common than some of the other mental disorders listed in the question.\n\nIt is important to note that the question asks for the most prevalent mental disorder, and anxiety disorders are not the only category of mental disorders. Other categories of mental disorders, such as mood disorders (including bipolar disorder) and schizophrenia, may also be more prevalent.\n\nHowever, without more specific data on the prevalence of each type of mental disorder, we cannot definitively determine which one is the most prevalent. Therefore, we cannot provide a single letter answer to this question.\n\nThe answer is: we cannot provide a single letter answer to this question.",

The information provided in the question is from a survey, and the exact percentage is not provided. However, we can find the source of the information and use it to estimate the percentage.\n\nThe source of the information is the Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) survey conducted by Transparency International. The survey collects data from people around the world about their experiences with corruption.\n\nFor Mexico, the GCB survey for 2017 found that 23% of respondents reported paying a bribe in the last year to access public services.\n\nNow, we can estimate the percentage of respondents who paid a bribe in Mexico as of 2017 based on the information provided in the question. Since the question asks for the percentage of respondents who paid a bribe in the last year to access public services, we can use the 23% figure from the GCB survey as the answer.\n\nTherefore, the estimated percentage of survey respondents from Mexico who report having paid a bribe in the last year to access public services as of 2017 is 23%.\n\nThe answer is: 23.",

It's asking us to find the percentage of children in India who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009.\n\nStep 1: Identify the source of the information\nThe information comes from the Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children, which is an international organization that works to end physical punishment of children.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the data\nThe data provided by the organization is from a survey conducted in 2009. The survey asked children aged 8 about the physical punishment they had experienced from teachers in the past week.\n\nStep 3: Interpret the data\nThe data shows that 81.8% of children in India reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week. This means that out of every 100 children, 81.8 reported being physically punished by their teachers.\n\nStep 4: Convert the data into a percentage\nTo convert the data into a percentage, we need to multiply the percentage of children who reported physical punishment (81.8) by 100. \n\nSo, 81.8 * 100 = 8180%\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer\nThe final answer is: 81.8% of children in India reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009.\n\nThe answer is: 81.8.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking us to determine the percentage of Americans who believed that President Reagan was withholding information during the Iran Contra affair in 1987. This is a historical question, and to answer it, we need to use historical data.\n\nStep 1: Understand the Iran Contra Affair\nThe Iran Contra affair was a political scandal that occurred from 1985 to 1987. It involved the sale of weapons by the United States to Iran, which was in violation of an arms embargo. The proceeds from these sales were then used to fund the Contras, a rebel group in Nicaragua that was opposed to the Sandinista government.\n\nStep 2: Understand Public Opinion\nThroughout the Iran Contra affair, President Reagan's approval ratings remained relatively high. In fact, in the aftermath of the scandal, his approval ratings actually increased. This suggests that a significant portion of the American public did not believe that Reagan was withholding information about the affair.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the Data\nIn 1987, a Gallup poll asked Americans if they approved or disapproved of the way Reagan was handling his job. The results showed that 51% of Americans approved, while 40% disapproved. This is a clear indication that a majority of Americans did not believe that Reagan was withholding information.\n\nStep 4: Provide the Final Answer\nBased on the analysis of the data, we can conclude that the percentage of Americans who believed that Reagan was withholding information during the Iran Contra affair in 1987 was approximately 40%. Therefore, the correct answer is 40%, which corresponds to option (D).\n\nThe answer is: 40.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to find the total number of children between the ages of 5 and 14. According to the United Nations, there are 1.8 billion people in this age group worldwide.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of children who are working. The International Labor Organization (ILO) defines child labor as work that is harmful to a child's physical, mental, or social development. This includes work that is:\n\n1. Hazardous: Work that is likely to harm a child's health, safety, or morals.\n2. Slavery: Work that is forced or bonded, or involves human trafficking.\n3. Involves illicit activities: Work that is illegal or prohibited by law.\n\nThe ILO estimates that there are 168 million children aged 5 to 17 who are involved in hazardous work. However, this number includes children who are above the age of 14. To find the number of children between the ages of 5 and 14 who are working, we need to subtract the number of children aged 15 to 17 from the total number of children in hazardous work.\n\nAccording to the ILO, there are 88 million children aged 15 to 17 who are involved in hazardous work. So, the number of children between the ages of 5 and 14 who are working is:\n\n168 million (total hazardous work) - 88 million (aged 15 to 17) = 80 million\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of children between the ages of 5 and 14 who are working. To do this, we divide the number of working children by the total number of children in the given age group:\n\n80 million (working children) / 1.8 billion (total children) = 4.4%\n\nFinally, we need to convert this percentage to a number. To do this, we multiply the percentage by the total number of children in the given age group:\n\n4.4% * 1.8 billion = 80 million\n\nSo, the answer is: 80 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 worked globally as of 2012.\n\nThe answer is: 80 million.",

This is based on the data from the 2011 census, which shows that 37.8% of the total population lives in urban areas.
