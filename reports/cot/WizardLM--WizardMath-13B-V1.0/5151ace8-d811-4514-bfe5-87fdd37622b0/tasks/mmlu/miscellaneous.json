            "model_answer": "To determine the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. The number of households in the United States.\n2. The number of people living in each household.\n3. The number of movies watched by each person.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of households in the United States.\nAccording to the 2017 American Community Survey, there are approximately 125,831,649 households in the United States.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of people living in each household.\nThe average number of people living in a household in the United States is 2.53. This number is derived from the 2017 American Community Survey.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of movies watched by each person.\nAssuming each person watches one movie per day, the total number of movies watched by each person in a year is 365 (days in a year).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year:\n\nTotal movies watched = (Number of households) * (Average number of people per household) * (Movies watched by each person per year)\n\nTotal movies watched = 125,831,649 * 2.53 * 365\n\nTotal movies watched \u2248 2,000,000,000\n\nSo, the answer is approximately 2,000,000,000 movies watched in homes in the United States in one year.\n\nThe answer is: 2,000,000,000.",

            "question": "How much energy do Americans waste each year by throwing out the unused ice in their drinks?\n\n(A) 6*10^8 J\n(B) 6*10^11 J\n(C) 6*10^14 J\n(D) 6*10^17 J",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the problem. We are asked to find the total energy wasted by Americans each year by throwing out the unused ice in their drinks. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the energy wasted per drink\nWe know that the melting point of ice is 0\u00b0C. To find out how much energy is required to melt one ton of ice, we need to know the specific heat capacity of water. The specific heat capacity of water is 4000 J/kg. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the energy wasted per drink, not per ton of ice. Since one drink typically contains one cube of ice, which weighs approximately 1 kg, we can use the specific heat capacity of water to calculate the energy wasted per drink. \n\nSo, 4000 J/kg * 1 kg = 4000 J/drink. This means that 4000 joules of energy are required to melt one cube of ice in a drink.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total energy wasted per year\nThe question tells us that Americans throw out 27,000,000,000 drinks each year. If each drink contains 4000 joules of energy, then the total energy wasted per year is 27,000,000,000 drinks * 4000 J/drink = 108,000,000,000 J.\n\nStep 3: Convert the total energy wasted to a more understandable unit\nThe question asks for the answer in joules. However, it might be easier to understand the answer in another unit, such as kilowatt hours (kWh). We know that 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) is equal to 3600 joules. \n\nSo, to convert the total energy wasted from joules to kilowatt hours, we divide the total energy wasted in joules by 3600. This gives us 108,000,000,000 J / 3600 = 30,000 kWh.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer\nThe final answer is 30,000 kWh. However, the question asks for the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else. Therefore, the final answer is (C) 6*10^14 J.\n\nThe answer is: 6*10^14 J.",

The difference in diameter between these two planets is 6,792 km - 4,878 km = 1,914 km.\n\nStep 3: Compare the differences in diameter for the other options.\n\nFor option (D), the difference in diameter between Jupiter and Saturn is 142,984 km - 120,536 km = 22,448 km, which is greater than the difference in diameter between Mars and Mercury.\n\nFor option (C), the difference in diameter between Uranus and Neptune is 51,118 km - 49,528 km = 1,590 km, which is smaller than the difference in diameter between Mars and Mercury.\n\nSince the difference in diameter between Mars and Mercury is the smallest among the given options, the two planets most similar in size diameter wise are Mars and Mercury.\n\nFinal Answer: The two planets most similar in size diameter wise are Mars and Mercury.\n\nThe answer is: The two planets most similar in size diameter wise are Mars and Mercury.",
