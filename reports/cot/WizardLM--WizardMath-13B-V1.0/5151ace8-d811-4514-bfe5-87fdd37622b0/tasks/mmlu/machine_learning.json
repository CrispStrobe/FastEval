If the learning rate is too large, the network may overfit the training data, resulting in a high variance model. If the learning rate is too small, the network may underfit the training data, resulting in a high bias model.\n\nFinding the optimal learning rate is a delicate balance, and it can be a challenge to determine the appropriate value for a specific problem.

Object detection involves locating and identifying objects in an image, while image classification is the process of assigning a single class label to the entire image. In the context of this question, we are dealing with bounding boxes and their relationships with image classification.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) Semantic segmentation models predict the class of each pixel, while multiclass image classifiers predict the class of entire image.\nThis statement is true. Semantic segmentation models are used to classify each pixel in the image, while multiclass image classifiers are used to classify the entire image into one of the predefined categories.\n\n(B) A bounding box with an IoU (intersection over union) equal to $96\\%$ would likely be considered at true positive.\nThis statement is true. The intersection over union (IoU) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of object detection models. A bounding box with an IoU of 96% indicates a high degree of overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth, which would likely be considered a true positive.\n\n(C) When a predicted bounding box does not correspond to any object in the scene, it is considered a false positive.\nThis statement is true. A false positive occurs when a predicted bounding box does not correspond to any object in the scene, but is still classified as a positive prediction.\n\n(D) A bounding box with an IoU (intersection over union) equal to $3\\%$ would likely be considered at false negative.\nThis statement is false. A false negative occurs when a ground truth object is not detected by the model, resulting in a missed prediction. However, the given statement refers to a bounding box with an IoU of 3%, which is not necessarily a false negative. A false negative would be a bounding box with an IoU close to 0%, as it would indicate a very low degree of overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth.\n\nIn conclusion, the false statement among the given options is (D).\n\nThe answer is: the false statement is (D).",

L1 regularization promotes sparsity by penalizing the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, while L2 regularization penalizes the sum of the squares of the coefficients.\n\nTo determine if L2 regularization makes models more sparse than L1 regularization, we need to compare their effects on the coefficients of a linear model. Since L2 regularization penalizes the sum of the squares of the coefficients, it will result in smaller coefficients than L1 regularization, which penalizes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. Smaller coefficients mean more sparse coefficients, so we can conclude that L2 regularization makes models more sparse than L1 regularization.\n\nStep 3: Analyze Statement 2\nResidual connections are a technique used in deep learning to improve the performance of neural networks.
