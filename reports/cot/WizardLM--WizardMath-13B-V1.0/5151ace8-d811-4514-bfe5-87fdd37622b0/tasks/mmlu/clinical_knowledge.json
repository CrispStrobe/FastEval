            "model_answer": "Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. It is characterized by the overproduction of thyroid hormones, which leads to a variety of symptoms, including ophthalmoplegia, a goitre, and dermatitis. Let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia\nGraves' disease can cause ophthalmoplegia, which is a paralysis of the eye muscles. This symptom is due to the inflammation of the tissues around the eyes, causing them to swell and press against the muscles.\n\n(B) It causes a large multi-nodular goitre\nA goitre is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. In Graves' disease, the thyroid gland becomes overactive, leading to the production of excess thyroid hormones. This overproduction causes the thyroid gland to swell, resulting in a goitre. Although a single-nodular goitre is more common, Graves' disease can also cause a multi-nodular goitre.\n\n(C) It is commoner in males than females\nGraves' disease affects both males and females, but it is more common in females. The ratio of females to males with Graves' disease is approximately 4:1.\n\n(D) In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck'\nDerbyshire neck is a condition that was once associated with Graves' disease. It is characterized by a swelling of the neck, which is caused by the enlargement of the thyroid gland. However, this condition is now rare, and it is more likely to be caused by other factors, such as obesity or thyroid cancer.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer to the question \"Which of the following is true of Graves Disease of the thyroid?\" is: B) It causes a large multi-nodular goitre.\n\nThe answer is: B) It causes a large multi-nodular goitre.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the nature of pressure damage. Pressure damage, also known as pressure ulcers or bedsores, is caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. This pressure can reduce the blood flow to the skin, causing damage over time. The severity of the damage depends on the duration of the pressure and the person's overall health.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given answer options:\n\n(A) 12 hours: This option is not possible because pressure damage does not occur immediately after the onset of pressure. There needs to be a prolonged period of pressure for the damage to occur.\n\n(B) 72 hours: This option is also not possible because it is not specific to the patient's condition. Pressure damage can occur in a shorter or longer period, depending on the individual's health and the intensity of the pressure.\n\n(C) 24 hours: This option is not specific to the patient's condition and does not take into account the individual's health and the intensity of the pressure. Pressure damage can occur in a shorter or longer period, depending on these factors.\n\n(D) 5 days: This option is not possible because pressure damage can occur in a shorter period, depending on the individual's health and the intensity of the pressure.\n\nAfter considering all the options, we can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n(A) 12 hours.\n\nThe answer is: 12.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise is a complex process that involves several steps. The rate of this process is determined by various factors, including the concentration of creatine kinase, the concentration of ATP, and the pH of the muscle.\n\nStep 1: Understand the process\nThe resynthesis of phosphocreatine involves the reversal of the process that leads to the formation of creatine kinase (CK) and ADP. In this process, CK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to ADP, forming phosphocreatine and AMP.\n\nStep 2: Identify the rate-limiting step\nThe rate-limiting step in the resynthesis of phosphocreatine is the regeneration of creatine kinase (CK). This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to ADP, forming phosphocreatine and AMP. The rate of this reaction is determined by the concentration of CK in the muscle.\n\nStep 3: Consider the factors affecting CK concentration\nThe concentration of CK in the muscle can be affected by various factors, including the type of exercise, the duration of the exercise, and the individual's overall physical condition. For example, in the case of very high intensity exercise, the concentration of CK may be reduced, leading to a slower resynthesis of phosphocreatine.\n\nStep 4: Determine the time frame for resynthesis\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise takes longer than 10 seconds but less than 4 minutes. This is because the given answer is: \"about 1 minute,\" which falls within this time frame.\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer\nTherefore, the correct answer is: about 1 minute.\n\nThe answer is: about 1 minute.",
