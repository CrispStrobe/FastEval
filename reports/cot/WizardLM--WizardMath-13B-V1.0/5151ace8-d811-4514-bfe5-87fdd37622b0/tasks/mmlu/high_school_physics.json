            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the given information\nWe know that the whiffle ball is tossed straight up, reaches a highest point, and falls back down. We are also given that air resistance is not negligible.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the ball's motion\nAt the highest point, the ball's speed with respect to the ground will be zero (as it momentarily stops before falling back down). However, the ball's speed with respect to the air will not be zero, as there is still some air resistance acting on it.\n\nStep 3: Determine the ball's acceleration\nAcceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. At the highest point, the ball's velocity with respect to the ground will be zero, but its velocity with respect to the air will not be zero. Therefore, the ball's acceleration will not be zero at the highest point, as there is still some air resistance acting on it.\n\nStep 4: Compare the time taken to travel up and down\nThe time taken for the ball to travel up to the highest point and the time taken for it to fall back down will be approximately equal. This is because the force of gravity acting on the ball is the same in both directions, and the only difference is the air resistance, which will affect the ball more when it is falling down.\n\nStep 5: Determine which statements are true\nBased on our analysis, we can now determine which statements are true:\n\nI. The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point. (False)\nII. The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point. (False)\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down. (True)\n\nStep 6: Provide the final answer\nThe statements that are true are I & III. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(C)}}$.\n\nThe answer is: \\text{(C)}.",
