            "model_answer": "To determine which segments are required to be separately disclosed, we need to refer to the relevant accounting standards. According to IAS 14, Segment Reporting, a company should disclose the following information for each operating segment:\n\n1. Reported revenue\n2. Reported profit (loss)\n3. Assets\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information for each segment:\n\nSegment A:\n- Reported revenue: $42 million\n- Reported profit (loss): $12 million\n- Assets: $470 million\n\nSegment B:\n- Reported revenue: $121 million\n- Reported profit (loss): $65 million\n- Assets: $800 million\n\nSegment C:\n- Reported revenue: $14 million\n- Reported profit (loss): $(3) million\n- Assets: $80 million\n\nBased on the information provided, we can determine which segments are required to be separately disclosed:\n\n- Segment A has reported revenue of $42 million and assets of $470 million, which meets the disclosure threshold of $50 million for both revenue and assets. Therefore, Segment A is required to be separately disclosed.\n- Segment B has reported revenue of $121 million and assets of $800 million, which meets the disclosure threshold of $50 million for both revenue and assets. Therefore, Segment B is required to be separately disclosed.\n- Segment C has reported revenue of $14 million and assets of $80 million, which does not meet the disclosure threshold of $50 million for both revenue and assets. Therefore, Segment C is not required to be separately disclosed.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis of the given information, Segments A and B are required to be separately disclosed in Swift's December 31 year 2 financial statements. The final answer is D) A B and C.\n\nThe answer is: D) A B and C.",

            "model_answer": "Comprehensive income is the sum of net income and all other changes in equity except for the changes in the common stock. \n\n1. First, we need to find the net income, which is given as $11,000.\n\n2. Next, we need to consider the net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. This is a positive $1,000, so it increases the comprehensive income.\n\n3. Then, we have an unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities of $3,000. This is a decrease in the comprehensive income.\n\n4. After that, we have a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2,000, which is a positive amount. This increases the comprehensive income.\n\n5. Finally, there is an increase in the common stock of $6,000. This does not affect the comprehensive income as it is a change in the equity but not in the income.\n\nNow, let's add up all these changes:\n\n- Net income: $11,000\n- Change in accounting principle: $1,000\n- Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities: -$3,000\n- Foreign currency translation adjustment: $2,000\n- Increase in common stock: $6,000\n\nSo, the comprehensive income is:\n\n$11,000 + $1,000 - $3,000 + $2,000 + $6,000 = $17,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Palmyra\u2019s comprehensive income is $17,000.\n\nThe answer is: 17,000.",

            "question": "The Houser Company has negotiated a $500,000 revolving credit agreement with Chitwood National Bank. The agreement calls for an interest rate of 10% on fund used, a 15% compensating balance, and a commitment fee of 1% on the unused amount of the credit line. Assuming that the compensating balance would not otherwise be maintained, the effective annual interest cost if the firm borrows $200,000 for one year is closest to\n\n(A) 11.5 percent.\n(B) 15 percent.\n(C) 26.5 percent.\n(D) 13.53 percent.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Calculate the interest on the borrowed amount.\nThe firm borrows $200,000 at an interest rate of 10%. To calculate the interest, we multiply the borrowed amount by the interest rate:\nInterest = $200,000 * 10% = $20,000\n\nStep 2: Calculate the compensating balance.\nThe firm is required to maintain a 15% compensating balance. To calculate the compensating balance, we multiply the borrowed amount by the compensating balance rate:\nCompensating Balance = $200,000 * 15% = $30,000\n\nStep 3: Calculate the commitment fee on the unused amount of the credit line.\nThe commitment fee is 1% on the unused amount of the credit line. Since the firm borrows $200,000 out of a $500,000 credit line, the unused amount is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000. To calculate the commitment fee, we multiply the unused amount by the commitment fee rate:\nCommitment Fee = $300,000 * 1% = $3,000\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total cost.\nNow, we need to add up the interest, compensating balance, and commitment fee to find the total cost:\nTotal Cost = Interest + Compensating Balance + Commitment Fee\nTotal Cost = $20,000 + $30,000 + $3,000 = $53,000\n\nStep 5: Calculate the effective annual interest cost.\nTo find the effective annual interest cost, we need to divide the total cost by the number of years (1) and then multiply by 100 to convert the percentage:\nEffective Annual Interest Cost = (Total Cost / Number of Years) * 100\nEffective Annual Interest Cost = ($53,000 / 1) * 100 = $53,000\n\nThe effective annual interest cost is closest to 53,000 percent. Therefore, the answer is (D) 53.00%.\n\nThe answer is: 53.00%.",

The check was redeposited on January 2 and cleared on January 9.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the NSF check\n- The $1,000 check was returned by the bank on December 30, so it was not cleared and not considered part of the December 31 checkbook balance.\n- Rune redeposited the check on January 2, and it cleared on January 9.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the correct checkbook balance on December 31\n- The correct checkbook balance should include the $4,000 check that was not cleared on December 31.\n- The correct checkbook balance should also include the $1,000 check that was returned on December 30 and redeposited on January 2, as it was part of the December 31 checkbook balance.\n- Therefore, the correct checkbook balance on December 31 is $10,000 (original balance) + $4,000 (not cleared check) + $1,000 (redeposited check) = $15,000.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the amount of cash in the December 31 balance sheet\n- The correct checkbook balance on December 31 is $15,000.\n- Since the checkbook balance is the amount of cash in the balance sheet, the answer is $15,000.\n\nFinal Answer: Rune should report $15,000 as cash in its December 31 balance sheet.\n\nThe answer is: 15000.",
