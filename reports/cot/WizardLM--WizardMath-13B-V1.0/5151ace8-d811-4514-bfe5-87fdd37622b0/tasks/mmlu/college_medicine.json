            "model_answer": "The main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is option D) uptake and oxidation by other tissues.\n\nLactate is a product of anaerobic metabolism in muscle, and it is released into the bloodstream when the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate clearance by the circulation. Lactate is then taken up by other tissues, such as the liver, heart, and kidneys, and oxidized to produce energy. The liver is the main organ for lactate clearance, but other tissues also contribute to the process. Therefore, the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is uptake and oxidation by other tissues.\n\nThe answer is: contribute to the process. Therefore, the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is uptake and oxidation by other tissues.",

For every adenine (a purine) there is a thymine (a pyrimidine) or vice versa, and for every guanine (another purine) there is a cytosine (another pyrimidine) or vice versa.

Elaborative rehearsal is a learning strategy where the learner associates new information with existing knowledge, making connections between the two. This helps the learner to better understand and remember the new information. In this case, the student is building on his previous knowledge of redox reactions to learn about electrochemical cells. By connecting the new information to what he already knows, he is able to better understand and retain the information.

            "model_answer": "When oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, the cell will switch to anaerobic respiration or fermentation to produce energy. In this process, the production of some molecules will stop, while others will continue to be produced.\n\n(A) Oxaloacetate: Oxaloacetate is a part of the citric acid cycle, which is a part of aerobic respiration. Since oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, the citric acid cycle will stop, and the production of oxaloacetate will stop.\n\n(B) Pyruvate: Pyruvate is a product of glycolysis, which is the first step of anaerobic respiration. Since the cell will switch to anaerobic respiration when oxygen is no longer supplied, the production of pyruvate will continue.\n\n(C) Water: Water is a byproduct of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration. It is produced when hydrogen ions are combined with electrons from the electron transport chain. Since the cell will continue to produce energy through anaerobic respiration, the production of water will continue.\n\n(D) Adenosine triphosphate (ATP): ATP is the energy currency of the cell. It is produced through the phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) using energy from either aerobic or anaerobic respiration. Since the cell will continue to produce energy through anaerobic respiration, the production of ATP will continue.\n\nTherefore, the molecule that will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell is Oxaloacetate (A).\n\nThe answer is: the molecule that will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell is Oxaloacetate (A).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "An intracellular buffer is a substance that helps to maintain the pH of the cytoplasm by absorbing or releasing hydrogen ions (H+). When the rate of glycolysis is high, the production of lactic acid increases, which leads to a decrease in pH. The decrease in pH can be buffered by substances that have a high capacity to bind H+.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Glutamine: Glutamine is an amino acid that can act as a buffer by donating or accepting H+. It has a high buffering capacity, making it an effective intracellular buffer.\n\n(B) Glucose: Glucose is a simple sugar that is the end product of glycolysis. However, it does not have a significant buffering capacity and is not used as an intracellular buffer.\n\n(C) Carnosine: Carnosine is a dipeptide that consists of the amino acids beta-alanine and histidine. It has a high buffering capacity, making it an effective intracellular buffer.\n\n(D) Amylase: Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into simpler sugars. However, it does not have a significant buffering capacity and is not used as an intracellular buffer.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is option (C) Carnosine.\n\nThe answer is: Carnosine.",
