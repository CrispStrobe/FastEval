            "model_answer": "First, we need to visualize the problem. We have a rectangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(3,2)$, and $(0,2)$. We want to find the probability that a randomly picked point $(x,y)$ inside this rectangle satisfies $x < y$.\n\nStep 1: Identify the region where $x < y$.\nTo do this, we can draw the line $x = y$ on the coordinate plane. This line divides the plane into two regions: one where $x < y$ and one where $x > y$. The region where $x < y$ is below the line $x = y$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the shape of the region where $x < y$.\nThe region below the line $x = y$ is a triangle. This triangle has vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$. \n\nStep 3: Calculate the area of the triangle.\nThe triangle has a base of 2 units (from $(0,0)$ to $(2,2)$) and a height of 2 units (from $(0,0)$ to $(0,2)$). The area of a triangle is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. So, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the area of the rectangle.\nThe rectangle has a width of 3 units (from $(0,0)$ to $(3,0)$) and a height of 2 units (from $(0,0)$ to $(0,2)$). The area of a rectangle is given by the formula $\\text{width} \\times \\text{height}$. So, the area of the rectangle is $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the probability.\nThe probability that a randomly picked point $(x,y)$ inside the rectangle satisfies $x < y$ is equal to the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle. So, the probability is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\nThe answer is: $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe answer is: \\frac{1}{3}.",
