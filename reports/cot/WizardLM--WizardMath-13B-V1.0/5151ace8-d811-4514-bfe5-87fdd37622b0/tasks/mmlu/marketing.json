However, this strategy does not align with the condition of setting a low price to gain market share.\n\n(B) Price skimming: This strategy involves setting a high price initially and then gradually lowering it over time. While this strategy can involve setting a low price at some point, it does not necessarily mean that the price is set low relative to the competition from the beginning.\n\n(C) Economy pricing: This strategy involves setting a low price for a product or service, often due to its perceived value or lack of features. This strategy aligns with the condition of setting a low price to gain market share.\n\n(D) Penetration pricing: This strategy involves setting a low price to enter a market and gain market share. This strategy also aligns with the condition of setting a low price to gain market share.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer\nBased on our analysis, the correct option is (C) Economy pricing, as it involves setting a low price relative to the competition to gain market share.
