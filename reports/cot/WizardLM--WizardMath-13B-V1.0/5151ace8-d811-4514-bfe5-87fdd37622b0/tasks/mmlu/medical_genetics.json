            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the context of the question. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with a particular trait, such as body mass index (BMI) in this case. The goal is to find SNPs that explain a significant portion of the variation in BMI.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given answer choices:\n\n(A) only 5%: This statement is incorrect because it is not supported by the given information. We know that GWAS have identified several SNPs associated with BMI, and these SNPs together explain a significant portion of the variation in BMI.\n\n(B) less than 1%: This statement is also incorrect. As mentioned earlier, GWAS have identified SNPs that explain a significant portion of the variation in BMI, and the percentage is certainly greater than 1%.\n\n(C) only 13%: This statement is incorrect as well. The percentage of variation explained by known SNPs is greater than 13%.\n\n(D) less than 2%: This statement is the correct answer. According to the information provided, known SNPs explain less than 2% of the variation in body mass index.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is: less than 2%.\n\nThe answer is: less than 2%.",

It is a powerful tool for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits, such as disease susceptibility, growth, and development. \n\nStep 1: Explain the problem\nWe are asked to identify the correct statement that describes the use of QTL analysis. We need to understand the different applications of QTL analysis and compare them with the given statement.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given statement\nThe given statement is: \"QTL analysis is used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross.\"\n\nStep 3: Compare the statement with the applications of QTL analysis\nWe need to compare the given statement with the four possible applications of QTL analysis mentioned in the question.\n\nApplication 1: Identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross\nThis application directly matches the given statement. QTL analysis is used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross.\n\nApplication 2: Determine which genes are expressed at a developmental stage\nThis application does not match the given statement. QTL analysis is not used to determine which genes are expressed at a developmental stage.\n\nApplication 3: Map genes in bacterial viruses\nThis application does not match the given statement. QTL analysis is not used to map genes in bacterial viruses.\n\nApplication 4: Identify RNA polymerase binding sites\nThis application does not match the given statement. QTL analysis is not used to identify RNA polymerase binding sites.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer\nSince the given statement matches the first application of QTL analysis, which is to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross, the correct answer is:\n\nQTL analysis is used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross.\n\nThe answer is: QTL analysis is used to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross.",

            "model_answer": "Leber's hereditary optic atrophy (LHON) is a genetic disorder that causes progressive vision loss and is caused by a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA. \n\nMitochondria are organelles that are found in most eukaryotic cells and are responsible for energy production. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a small circular DNA molecule that is separate from the nuclear DNA found in the cell's nucleus. \n\nLHON is a maternally inherited disorder, meaning that it is passed down from mother to child. This is because mitochondria are only passed down from the mother's egg cell to the child. \n\nThe mutation that causes LHON is a point mutation, which means that a single base pair in the mtDNA is replaced by another base pair. This mutation is known as the G11778A mutation, where the base pair guanine (G) is replaced by the base pair adenine (A) at position 11778 in the mtDNA. \n\nSo, the correct answer is: D) mitochondrial DNA.\n\nThe answer is: D) mitochondrial DNA.",
