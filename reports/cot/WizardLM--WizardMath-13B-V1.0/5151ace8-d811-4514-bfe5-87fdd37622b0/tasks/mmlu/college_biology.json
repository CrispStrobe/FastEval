            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To find the complementary sequence, we need to understand the process of DNA complementary. The complementary sequence is determined by the base-pairing rules of DNA, which states that adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). \n\nGiven the sequence 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032, let's break it down and find the complementary sequence step by step:\n\n1. The first base is 'C'. Since it's a 'G' in the given sequence, we need to find the complementary base. According to the base-pairing rules, 'G' pairs with 'C', so the complementary base for 'C' is 'G'.\n\n2. The second base is 'G'. As it's an 'A' in the given sequence, we need to find the complementary base. According to the base-pairing rules, 'A' pairs with 'T', so the complementary base for 'G' is 'T'.\n\n3. The third base is 'A'. It's a 'T' in the given sequence, so the complementary base is 'A'.\n\n4. The fourth base is 'T'. It's a 'G' in the given sequence, so the complementary base is 'C'.\n\n5. The fifth base is 'T'. It's an 'A' in the given sequence, so the complementary base is 'T'.\n\n6. The sixth base is 'G'. It's a 'T' in the given sequence, so the complementary base is 'A'.\n\nNow, let's put the complementary bases together to form the complementary sequence:\n\n5\u2032 GCG ATG 3\u2032\n\nSo, the complementary sequence is 5\u2032 GCG ATG 3\u2032, which corresponds to answer choice (B) 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032.\n\nThe answer is: B) 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032.",

The correct statement(s) among the given options are:\n\n1. It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum. (A)\nThe Golgi apparatus is a stack of flattened sacs, and it is oriented in the cytoplasm such that its cis face (the face closest to the endoplasmic reticulum) is on top. This arrangement allows for the efficient transport of materials from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.\n\n2. It is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face. (B)\nThe Golgi apparatus is associated with small secretory vesicles, which are responsible for the packaging and transport of proteins and lipids. These vesicles are located near the cis face of the Golgi apparatus, where the materials are sorted and prepared for secretion.\n\n3. Its composite flattened cisternae are continuous with one another. (C)\nThe Golgi apparatus is composed of multiple flattened sacs, called cisternae. These cisternae are stacked on top of each other and are continuous with one another, forming a single, uninterrupted structure. This arrangement allows for the efficient transport of materials through the Golgi apparatus.\n\n4. Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into its lumen. (D)\nThe Golgi apparatus is involved in the glycosylation of certain secretory proteins. This process involves adding sugar molecules to the proteins, which can occur before or after the proteins enter the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. In this case, the correct statement is that glycosylation can occur prior to the protein's entry into the lumen.\n\nIn summary, the correct statements are (A), (B), and (C).

The first sperm cell fuses with the egg cell to form a zygote, while the second sperm cell fuses with the polar nuclei to form the endosperm. \n\nStep 1: Identify the structures involved in double fertilization.\n- Zygote: The zygote is the result of the fusion of the egg cell and the first sperm cell. It is the first cell of the embryo.\n- Polar nuclei: The polar nuclei are the two nuclei that lie opposite to each other at the tip of the female gamete (the egg cell).\n- Endosperm: The endosperm is the nutritive tissue inside the seed, formed by the fusion of the second sperm cell with the polar nuclei.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given options and determine which one corresponds to the formation of the endosperm.\n- Option A: Megagametophyte\n   - The megagametophyte is the female gametophyte, which is the plant embryo inside the ovule. It is not related to the formation of the endosperm.\n- Option B: Endodermis\n   - The endodermis is a layer of cells in the stem that controls the flow of water and minerals. It is not related to the formation of the endosperm.\n- Option C: Embryo\n   - The embryo is the developing plant inside the seed. It is not related to the formation of the endosperm, as the endosperm is a nutritive tissue that nourishes the embryo.\n- Option D: Endosperm\n   - The endosperm is the nutritive tissue inside the seed, formed by the fusion of the second sperm cell with the polar nuclei.

However, they are not the main component of the subunit in question, which is the protein octomer. So, histone is not the correct answer.\n\n(B) Chromatin: Chromatin is the combination of DNA and protein that forms the structure of the chromosome. However, the subunit in question is a smaller structure within the chromatin. So, chromatin is not the correct answer.\n\n(C) Nucleosome: A nucleosome is a structure in the chromatin that consists of 146-147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a protein octamer. The subunit in question has a different number of base pairs (134) and is not a nucleosome. So, nucleosome is not the correct answer.\n\n(D) Solenoid: A solenoid is a coil or a helix, which is the shape of the subunit in question. The subunit consists of 134-base-pair long stretches of DNA surrounded by a protein octomer, forming a structure that resembles a solenoid.

Bacteria have three main functions: peptidoglycan synthesis, protein synthesis, and DNA synthesis. Antibiotics that affect bacterial cells interfere with one or more of these functions.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n1. Peptidoglycan synthesis (A): This is the process of creating the cell wall of the bacteria. Antibiotics that target this function, such as penicillin, prevent the bacteria from forming a strong cell wall, leading to their death.\n\n2. Protein synthesis (B): This is the process of creating new proteins within the bacteria. Antibiotics that target this function, such as tetracycline, prevent the bacteria from producing essential proteins, leading to their death.\n\n3. DNA synthesis (C): This is the process of creating new DNA within the bacteria. Antibiotics that target this function, such as rifampicin, prevent the bacteria from replicating their genetic material, leading to their death.\n\n4. Reverse transcriptase (D): This is an enzyme used by some viruses to convert RNA into DNA. However, it is not a function of bacterial cells. Therefore, antibiotics that target this function would not affect bacteria and would only affect viruses.\n\nNow, we need to find the option that is not related to the three main functions of bacterial cells.
