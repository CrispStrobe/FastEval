	"1": "Dear Diary,\n\nTwo lost babes in the woods. Hansel & Gretel. Scrawny little things. Couldn't leave them. Not like villagers left me. Took them in. Fed them. They smiled. Warmed my heart. \n\nVillagers never got me. Feared my herbs, my charms. Drove me out, called me \"witch\". But these children, they're different. They see the real me.\n\nDear Diary,\n\nChildren been here a while. Love my cooking, my stories. Gretel asked about my past. Told her I'm misunderstood, an outcast. She hugged me tight. Felt like love. Been so long.\n\nHansel's quiet. Catches me watching. Can't read him. Left me a carved heart. \"To remind you we're grateful,\" he said. Didn't meet my eyes. Want to believe it's love. Brings light to my darkness. I have hope.\n\nDear Diary,\n\nHeard children whisper in the night. Planning escape. Back to Papa who left them for dead. After my love, my care! Can't let them go. They belong here, with me. Must protect them from the cruel world. Even if they hate me for it.\n\nDear Diary,  \n\nLocked the doors. Sealed windows with charms. Gretel screamed, cried, begged. Ungrateful brat! Held her close, told her it's for their own good. She fought me. Called me \"wicked witch\". Just like villagers. Thought she was different. Thought it was love. Hurts, but must stay strong. They'll see, someday.\n\nGave Hansel sweets. Peace offering. He stared. Dead eyes. Barely ate. Just tired? Or something more? No, can't be. He's just quiet. They do love me, I know it. How could they not? Won't let fear ruin this.\n\nDear Diary,\n\nWoke choking on smoke. Fire everywhere. Ran to their room. Empty. Cold. Oven open, laughing at me. Mocking.\n\nCouldn't believe it. Searched woods for hours. Screaming their names. Refusing the truth. But then cruel dawn came. Reality sank in. \n\nThey left me. Betrayed me. Used my oven. Escaped the home I made. Gave them everything. My food, my stories, my heart. This is my repayment? Thieves in the night. Not even goodbye.\n\nMy fate. Alone. Rejected. Reviled. Mad old witch. Mourning love that was a lie. I see now. It was a trick. A game. Fool to think they could love me.\n\nLet them die out there. I'm done. Done with this world. False hopes, knives in back. Never again. No more open doors. No more pain. I'll be hard now. Cold. As the world made me. A witch needs no heart."
